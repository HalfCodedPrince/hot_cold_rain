## Use
Night watch at crab yards and hull slips; taps when hulls scrape or boards flex.

## Traits
- Enlarged **chordotonal organs**; carapace ridge acts as a resonator.
- Distinct substrate **drumming** language (yard hands learn 3–5 calls).

## Risk
- **Stampedes** under parade drums; posted quiet rings around yards; satyr fines escalate by drum size.
