South of the Bright Sea. North coast opens to the Bright Sea; southwest to the Moss Sea; southeast to the Blue Bird Sea; south to the Long Ocean; northwest to the Singing Sea; northeast toward the Green Peaks.

## Shape
Elongated “splat”; one long peninsula trends southeast; several larger islands lie to the south.

## Notes
Moist interiors toward reed belts; typhoon corridors on east coasts.
