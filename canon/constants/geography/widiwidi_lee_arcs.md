# Widiwidi Lee Arcs

## Basemap
- **Physiography:** steep cones, black-sand hooks, lava headlands; narrow shelves with sudden depth near shore.
- **Winds & seas:** strong lee effects and williwaws; refracted swell; confused chop at headland corners.
- **Shelter:** sparse good anchorages; knowledge of “breathing coves” is navigator capital.

## Hazards
Ashfall seasons; pumice rafts; sudden squalls off heated slopes; reported magnetic fuss near certain headlands.
