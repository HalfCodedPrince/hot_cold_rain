# Kahet Uplands & Pass Country

## Basemap
- **Structure:** high crest with short, steep windward shoulders; long lee spurs to interior marsh belts.
- **Drainage:** headwaters converge into the Salt; braided fans at pass feet.
- **Winds/seasonality:** snow loads and avalanche chutes on windward; dry summer winds on lee.

## Corridors & gates
- **Kahet Gates:** all-season ford north of crest; switchback road with toll houses and oath-stones.
- **Winter roads:** frozen marsh belts open north of crest; carts give way to pack trains.
- **Knife passes:** narrow saddles with cribbing and snow sheds where funded.

## Hazards
Avalanche paths and washouts sever passes in green years; thaw floods cut winter lines; shifting scree fans after late storms.
