# Continent Widiwidi

## Location
East of Ord, between the Stern Ocean (north) and the Long Ocean (south and east). Opens to three seas: Ash (west) → Stern, Lull (east) → Long, Moth (south) → Long. Linked toward Ord/Sar via the Green Peaks.

## Shape
Elongated trapezoid; deep bay to the south; several big islands around.

## Notes
Arc volcanism; ash years alter yields; active straits toward the Ash and Moth Seas.
