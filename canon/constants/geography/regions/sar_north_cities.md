## Thesis
Belt of semi-independent cities — Tau-Hi, Seven Fingers, Knees — under not-quite-tributary compacts (late Cadence → Ord–Sar eras; **pre-Principality**).

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coast & cuts.** Drowned valleys and reef passes; steep headlands splitting short bays; bars at river mouths.
- **Harbors.** Narrow, defensible inlets with stair quays; tide slots govern access windows.
- **Hinterland.** Short, steep drainages; ridge roads limited; most freight rides the sea.

## Compacts & lanes
City leagues trade pilotage and defense; compacts specify tribute-in-kind and ritual precedence rather than tax; convoy lanes pivot at Seven Fingers.

## Era touchpoints
- **Pre-Principality.** City-to-city compacts, marque letters, and pilot exchanges dominate.
- **Pamphlet century.** Stage houses host diplomacy; league charters standardize dues and oath forms.
- **Post-1503.** Mixed-court forms seep in; Access Day harmonization eases convoy timetables.

## Legend anchors
Tau-Hi stairs; Seven Fingers reef-cut; Knees headland narrows; compact stones; pilot halls.
