## Thesis
Temple-city terraces step from uplands to causewayed ports; **flood calendars** govern both rice paddies and harbor gates, exporting **calendar prestige** along convoy lanes.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Physiography.** Terraced valleys descending to ria/lagoon coasts; barrier spits and reef-rimmed inlets.
- **Hydrology.** Monsoon-fed floods set sow/harvest; tide slots regulate gate piers.
- **Works.** **Causeways** and gate-piers mark harbor mouths; **measure-stone** tolls standardize dues.

## Lanes & harbors
Causeway ports act as relay nodes to Bright Sea marts; pilots treat lee arcs as a single navigational language; reef cuts and tide windows dominate scheduling.

## Rite & diplomacy
**Choir embassies** exchange house-songs; terraces double as refuges; public Rhythm minimum in ports, **Old Word** kept on terraces.

## Era touchpoints
- **c.0 AO.** Flood calendars run farm and dock; stepped sanctuaries serve as refuges.
- **Early 1400s.** North Kllrian joins league; privateerization routinized under marque.
- **Pamphlet era.** Presses tolerated if quiet; treaty preambles adopt house-song openings.

## Economy & exports
Papers, paddy, lacquer, bast cordage, terrace stone; pilots and Works clerks carry **calendar prestige** abroad.

## Legend anchors (map cues)
Causeways and gate piers; measure-stone tolls; choir halls near harbor stairs.
