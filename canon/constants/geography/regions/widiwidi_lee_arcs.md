## Thesis
Volcanic island chains cast **lee coves** and tricky wind shadows; the arcs are rich in **pilot lore** and rumor-laden landfalls that punctuate long convoys.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Physiography.** Steep cones, black-sand hooks, lava headlands; narrow shelves; sudden depth near shore.
- **Winds & seas.** Strong lee effects and williwaws; refracted swell; confused chop at headland corners.
- **Shelter density.** Sparse good anchorages; knowledge of “breathing coves” is pilot capital.

## Lanes & pilotage
Convoys step between lee arcs; local pilots trade chant-lines and “shadow times”; some landfalls only open under specific wind/sea meshes.

## Hazards
Ashfall seasons; pumice rafts; sudden squalls off heated slopes; magnetic fuss near certain headlands (pilot superstition whether real or not).

## Era touchpoints
Charts consolidate chant-lines into printed marginalia in pamphlet century; after 1503, Access Day postings include lee-arc cautions during green years.

## Legend anchors
Black-sand hooks; breathing coves; chant-line stones; “shadow times” notes; pumice lines after eruptions.
