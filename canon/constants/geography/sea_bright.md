# Bright Sea

## Location
Between Ord and Sar over a shallow ridge. Opens to: Stern via Green Peaks; Singing to the west.

## Physiology & lanes
- **Currents:** Old Song stitches Ordâ†”Sar on fair sets; return eddies run lee-side of arcs.
- **Wind & seasons:** trade-like summer sets; storm corridors in shoulder months.
- **Bathymetry:** ridge shelf, patch reefs, mangrove fringes in the west; deep cuts at Seven Fingers (generalized).
- **Navigation:** predictable **reef cuts** and lee corridors enable convoyization.
