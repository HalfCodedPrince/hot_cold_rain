# Sar Littoral Belt

## Basemap
- **Coastform:** barrier lagoons and river mouths with stepped masonry stairs; mangrove backwaters; sandspits across minor outlets.
- **Monsoon swing:** strong seasonal wind/sea-state changes; inshore movement favors shallow-draft craft.

## Lanes
Inshore outriggers and barges stitch city belts; timing bars and reef cuts governs passages.
