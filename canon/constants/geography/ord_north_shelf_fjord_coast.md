# Ord North Shelf & Fjord Coast

## Basemap
- **Coast:** deep fjords, skerries, storm gaps; sea-ice in shoulder seasons.
- **Shelf:** productive shallows; amber lines on storm beaches; few year-round harbors.

## Hazards
Pack ice, bergy bits, sudden katabatic gusts in fjords; poor shelter density between good ports.
