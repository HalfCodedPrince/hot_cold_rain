## Thesis
Dye-and-salt metropolises ride stepped shrine-stairs along a monsoon coast; **processional ramps** tie civic time to tides, and **mixed guild/temple courts** set the legal tone that later scales into treaty-port practice.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coastform.** Barrier lagoons and river mouths with stepped masonry stairs; mangrove backwaters; sandspits across minor outlets.
- **Monsoon swing.** Strong seasonal wind/sea state changes; fair-weather outriggers and shallow barges dominate inter-city movement.

## Lanes & craft
- **Inshore:** outriggers + barge chains stitch city belts; pilots time bars and reef cuts.
- **Inland:** rivers first, foot second; packways use levees; shell roads over dunes.

## Law & custom
- Court arcades blend guild custom and shrine oath; *shell-bonds* (coastal scrip/warrant receipts) travel up and down the coast.

## Era touchpoints
- **c.0 AO.** Processional ramps bind civic life to tides; shell-bonds circulate.
- **Pamphlet era.** City belts tolerate presses if quiet; Sea-Lotus humanism colors festival clocks.
- **After 1503.** Treaty-port habits and mixed-court DNA propagate into Ord–Sar practice; Access Days harmonize with shrine calendars.

## Legend anchors
Processional ramps; river stairs; dye-yard pans; salt flats; shell-bond houses; barge ferries at lagoon mouths.
