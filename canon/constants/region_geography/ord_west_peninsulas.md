## Thesis
String of capes and low peninsulas controlling **lee-arc navigation** and tollable narrows; **cape forts** and coerced city-states edge into the Ordâ€“Sar sphere.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coast.** Alternating cliff and sand hook capes; hazardous shoals off points; sparse good anchorages.
- **Control.** Fort strings on capes and isthmuses; navigator stairs at tollable narrows; hinterlands thin.

## Hazards
Lee traps behind hooks in storm sets; sand migration closes minor cuts; water scarcity inland.
