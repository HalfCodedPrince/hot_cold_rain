## Thesis
A shallow-ridge inland seaway whose **Old Song** current stitches Ord and Sar; archipelago shelves create predictable **reef cuts** and lee corridors that make convoyization possible.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Currents:** Old Song (Ordâ†’Sar) on fair winds; return eddies along lee arcs.
- **Wind & seasons:** trade-like summer sets; storm corridors in shoulder months.
- **Bathymetry:** ridge shelf, patch reefs, mangrove fringes west; deep cuts at Seven Fingers.
