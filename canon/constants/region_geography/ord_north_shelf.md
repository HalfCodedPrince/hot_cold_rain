## Thesis
Subpolar fjords and a broad shelf with short summers; 

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coast.** Deep fjords, skerries, storm gaps; sea-ice in shoulder seasons.
- **Shelf.** Productive shallows; amber lines on storm beaches; few year-round harbors.

## Hazards
Pack ice, bergy bits, sudden katabatic gusts in fjords; poor shelter density between good ports.
