## Thesis
Volcanic island chains cast **lee coves** and tricky wind shadows

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Physiography.** Steep cones, black-sand hooks, lava headlands; narrow shelves; sudden depth near shore.
- **Winds & seas.** Strong lee effects and williwaws; refracted swell; confused chop at headland corners.
- **Shelter density.** Sparse good anchorages; knowledge of “breathing coves” is pilot capital.

## Hazards
Ashfall seasons; pumice rafts; sudden squalls off heated slopes; magnetic fuss near certain headlands (pilot superstition whether real or not).
