## Thesis
**Twin rivers, canals, and marsh polders** form a crescent of ferries and levee towns; **collegia embryos** appear where river meets sea (navigator-magistrates, berths, weights).

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Hydrology.** Braided channels, levee crowns, backswamps; canal gates and ferry chains set movement.
- **Land use.** Lime pits, salt pans, grain polders; kiln smoke marks towns.

## Lanes & polity
Ferries at crown crossings; levee-top roads; estuary collegia arbitrate weights/berths and seed Ord’s council culture.

## Era touchpoints
c.0 AO: canal gates and ferry chains define politics; later, collegia mature into Councils of Ord.

## Legend anchors
Ferry chains, gate houses, levee crowns, kiln belts, estuary collegia stairs.
