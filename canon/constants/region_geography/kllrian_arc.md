## Thesis
Temple-city terraces step from uplands to causewayed ports; **flood calendars** govern both rice paddies and harbor gates, exporting **calendar prestige** along convoy lanes.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Physiography.** Terraced valleys descending to ria/lagoon coasts; barrier spits and reef-rimmed inlets.
- **Hydrology.** Monsoon-fed floods set sow/harvest; tide slots regulate gate piers.
- **Works.** **Causeways** and gate-piers mark harbor mouths; **measure-stone** tolls standardize dues.
