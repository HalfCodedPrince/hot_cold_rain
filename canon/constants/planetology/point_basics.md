# Planet Point (Basics)

## Axial tilt & year
Tilt slightly greater than Earth’s; rainy/dry swings, sharp monsoon fronts. Year ~370 days; calendars harmonized ~700 AO.

## Circulation
Warm equatorial current **Old Song** runs Ord ↔ Sar via shallow ridge. Strong monsoons; typhoon corridors along east coasts.

## Habitability
Coastal settlement bias; inland rivers crucial. Green rain episodes: see Hydrology.
