## Macro-plates
ORD plate (north), SAR plate (south), WID plate (east/young, volcanic). Oceanic microplates along Ord–Sar straits.

## Orogeny
Too-Kahet range: compressional uplift on ORD margin. Ord uplands: older eroded orogen. Widiwidi: active arcs; ash cycles affect climate.

## Hazards
Quakes near subduction zones; tsunamis periodic on east-facing coasts.

## Outline
- **Rifted ancestors:** Ord and Sar split from a shared massif; the **Old Song basin** is a shallow, archipelago-rich sea over a broad ridge.
- **Island arcs:** Widiwidi arises on volcanic arcs; active margins seed fertile soils and hazard decades.
- **Sediments & fuels:** Ancient wetland deltas along Ord–Sar coasts built organic-rich basins; coal/oil/gas occur in pockets; storms and silt complicate extraction.
- **Shock years:** volcanic ash decades perturb rain and light; remembered in rites and calendar notes.
