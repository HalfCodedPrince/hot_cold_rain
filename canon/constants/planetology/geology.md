# Geology & Plates

## Macro-plates
ORD plate (north), SAR plate (south), WID plate (east/young, volcanic).  
Oceanic microplates along Ordâ€“Sar straits.

## Orogeny
Too-Kahet range: compressional uplift on ORD margin.  
Ord uplands: older eroded orogen.  
Widiwidi: active arcs; ash cycles affect climate.

## Hazards
Quakes near subduction zones; tsunamis periodic on east-facing coasts.
