## Axial Tilt & Seasonality
Point’s axial tilt is **moderately greater than Earth’s**. Seasonal swings are sharper; monsoon fronts shift quickly. Hex’s strong tides modulate cloud decks and downpours.

## Latitudinal Belts (broad)
- **Equatorial–Tropical (±0–30°):** hot, humid belts; rainforest, mangrove, reef coasts; violent convection on “green rain” days.
- **Subtropical–Temperate (30–60°):** seasonal forests and grasslands; **limited savanna pockets** where rainshadow allows.
- **Polar–Subpolar (≥60°):** tundra margins; seasonal melt windows; interior icefields on high plateaus.

## Polar Notes
Brief bright summers enable rush-growth tundra; winters plunge well below freezing. Coastal polars see seasonal leads; interior land can host multi-year ice.
