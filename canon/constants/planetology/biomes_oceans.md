## Coasts (Ord & Sar)
- **Rainforests** grade to **mangroves** at deltas and estuaries; green-rain events spur algal blooms.
- Inland belts shift to **deciduous** and **savanna** mosaics with distance from the Bright Sea.

## Widiwidi (island arcs)
Island chains range from dry tropical scrub to terrace forests. Isolation yields endemics; pulses of land-bridge exposure remix lineages.

## Reefs & Nurseries
Warm, clear shallows around the Old Song ridge support **coral reef complexes**, mangrove nurseries, and dense reef-fish/crustacean webs. Green-rain years lower clarity and slow growth; pilots carry **leaf errata** to add caution days.

## Rivers & Estuaries
Brackish transitions host amphibious life (eels, crabs, lilies). Flood pulses are culturally scheduled via the Rhythm to protect stores and works.
