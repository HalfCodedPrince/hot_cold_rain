# Climate of the Bright Sea

## The Old Song (basin gyre)
- **Pattern:** A monsoon-like **seasonal gyre**: northbound along Sar in the dry, south/eastbound along Ord in the wet.  
- **Beats:** Short-Beat windows (safe); Long-Beat anomalies (rare, high risk).  
**Risk/Failure modes:** slight phase shifts + seawall success = **sediment misplacement** → dredge debt.

## Green Rains
- **Nature:** wind-driven green algal aerosols + rain tint, strongest at bright-sea turnarounds; sticky films rot cordage and grain.  
- **Seasonality:** peaks when Old Song flips; strongest on windward reef belts.  
- **Mitigation:** oiled cloths, resin caulk, raised granaries, fog-bell cleaning cycles.
**Risk/Failure modes:** storage spoilage spikes; reed-camp disease seasons worsen.

## Storms & Lanes
- **Headland vortices** predictable; **emerald squalls** (green-tinted downpours) mark shear lines.  
- **Capes** amplify hazard when dredge cycles slip; watch bells carry farther in wet air.

## Inland bands
- **North-Ord uplands:** cool, gusty; pass snow in Long-Beat extremes.  
- **Sar interior:** wet-hot with break-monsoon drought pockets; fever corridors along reed belts.  
- **Kllrian arcs:** orographic uplift → terrace-friendly rain; volcanic ash years boost yields.

## Multi-decadal variance (Cadence era)
- Subtle **30–40y swings** in Old Song strength; coincident with reef growth pulses.  
- Correlated **premium cycles** (insurance tables quietly adjust).  
**Risk/Failure modes:** a bad swing can set the table for the **Quiet Panic**.

## Variance & chronology (deep time → Last War)

- **Prehistory (repeating ~200–500y regimes):** alternating rough/fair windows tied to basin gyre strength; reef and delta growth modulate storm tracks.
- **Golden Cadence fair phase (c. 880–1040 AO):** steadier Old Song windows; night entries normalize; dredge cycles predictable.
- **Slow worsening (c. 1400–1500 AO):** longer shoulder seasons, stronger emerald squalls, rising cordage/grain spoilage risk.
- **1503 AO — Day of the Green Skies:** basin-wide aerosol bloom; harbor closures, sail/cordage failures, spoilage; emergency edicts.
- **Recovery (early 1500s+):** conditions improve; buffers/standards remain stricter than pre-1500.
- **Last War instability (1765–1766 AO):** regime hiccup; headland vortices off-schedule, convoy windows slip; supply stress and food prices spike.
