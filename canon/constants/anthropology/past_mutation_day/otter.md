Semi-aquatic line for **flood crews, lock-tenders, and salvage**; kit focuses on **hydro weave**, **quick-drain hems**, **anti-slip footing**.

## Morphology
Partial webbing (hands/feet); dense oil-shedding coat; pronounced **dive reflex** with thorax compliance; canal stoppers/ear **baffles** common.

## Health
Ear infections; skin fungal risk if gear isn’t dried; cold/wet exposure disciplines; bathhouses often double as clinics (quiet lanes posted).

## Dialects (ward splits)
**Reedcat** riggers in print lofts (humid wards); **Cold-otter** with snow baffles; river **quay crews** variants.

## Culture & Work
Dock crews, lock-tenders, salvage divers, river navigators; witness crews in flood/lock incident dockets.

## Law & Safety
Identity rolls variably enforced inland; **cold-water negligence** is a named tort (crew leads held). Sanctuary codes standardize **greenborn** and **overswitch** care.

## Clothing
**Hydro weave** (oiled felt/linen) that sheds water without smell-binding; **quick-drain hems**; wrist **dry cords**; **ear baffles** and canal stoppers for cold dives; **anti-slip soles**; work aprons that fold up as drag-guards; rust-gentle tool wraps.
