Population-level trends shaped by heat, humidity, work, and diet:

- **Skin:** medium to dark browns predominate; shade culture (hats/ponchos/galleries) moderates UV.
- **Hair:** dark, straight→wavy common; lighter browns/reddish strands appear in port cosmopoleis.
- **Build:** compact, wiry muscle; heat routine + walking labor.  
- **Eyes:** dark browns most common; hazel/amber rare; fold variants present across belts.
- **Nose/lips:** broader noses, open nostrils; full lips frequent in equatorial belts.
- **Stature:** ~162–173 cm typical, varying with nutrition and work.
- **Marks:** callus culture (rope, oar, quay); tattoos and scar lines concentrated in port houses and temple orders.
- **Diet:** starch, greens, seafood; low-lactose tolerance is common; temple kitchens adapt recipes accordingly.

*Use trends as texture; avoid treating them as essences. Port history mixes everything.*
