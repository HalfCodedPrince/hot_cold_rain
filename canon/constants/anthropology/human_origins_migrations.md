## Thesis
Archaeology and oral strata point to a **Sar (south)** origin for modern humans, with multiple pulses moving north into **Ord** and west into **Widiwidi**. Maritime corridors along the Bright Sea seeded island arcs early.

## Outline
- **Deep time (pre-Ord):** Sar river basins and mangrove belts host the oldest sites; maritime rafts appear early.
- **Archipelago spread:** stepping-stone settlement tracks seasonal currents (proto–Old Song lanes).
- **Secondary consolidation (Ord):** political and calendrical systems cohere later on the northern coasts.
- **First Blindness:** climatic disruption + sea-level swings fragment writing and trade; Sar memory persists in ritual and meter.

## Matters later
Colonial/republican rhetoric oscillates between “we all come from Sar” and northern myths (Krum as adopted ancestry).
