**The Old Song** is the reliable crossing between Ord and Sar:
- Driven by **tideway rectification** over a **shallow ridge** and amplified during the long Hex-Oboe beat; produces a **residual set** usable for eastbound crossings on one half-cycle and westbound on the other.
- Periodicity: short beat ~14 days (springs/neaps), long seasonal swing ~half-year; pilots time departures to “sing with the set.”
- In foul years of heavy green-rain blooms, drag increases; compositories issue **pilot-leaf errata** to adjust timings.

Sailors speak of “hearing” the Old Song when the wake hums against the ridge and the sky glows with Hex’s halo.
