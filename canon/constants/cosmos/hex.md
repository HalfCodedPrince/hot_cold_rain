# Hex (Point’s Moon)

## Physical
Large apparent size; semi-diurnal tides; alignment peaks drive “king tides.” Albedo patching yields dramatic brightness swings.

## “Green nights”
Green-tinged nights occur when light scatters through aerosolized upper-air loads following green-rain conditions. See Hydrology for advisories.

## Cultural
Tide omens; “Queen’s Halo” ring as rain sign; morning hymns synced to Hexset before Oboe-rise.
