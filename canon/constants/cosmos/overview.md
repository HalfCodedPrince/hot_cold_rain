# Cosmos Overview

## Star (Oboe)
Yellow-dwarf primary; steady output; temple ephemerides published from c. 700 AO. Dawn rites tie hymn timing to Oboe-rise.

## Planetary family (canonical names)
- **Point** — our world.
- **Hex** — large-apparent moon; “green nights” episodic under aerosol loads.
- **Karodot** — distant blue-white giant; faint ring; many “daughters.”
- **Bean** — inner dwarf; best at dawn/dusk elongations; bright but small.
- **Ze** — cold, eccentric outer dwarf; long year.
- **Karodot’s Tears** — main-belt between Point and Karodot.
- **Trailing Belt** — distant icy bodies beyond Ze (low certainty historically).

## Observational notes
- Public ephemerides: temple calendars (ERA-700+).
- navigator-books: sunrise/Hex tables for convoy timing.
- Children’s primers exist; treat as secondary sources.

## Pointers
See `canon/systems/cosmos/index.md` for IDs; pages linked above for details.
