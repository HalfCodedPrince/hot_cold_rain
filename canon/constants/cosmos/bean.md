# Bean (Inner Dwarf)

- Orbit interior to Point; best seen near dawn/dusk elongations.
- Bright but small in apparent disk; no known habitability.
- Naming tradition credits a Widiwidi observerâ€™s snack anecdote; later standardized in temple almanacs.

## Observational notes
Short elongation windows; low altitude and glare near Oboe complicate naked-eye tracking. Almanacs list first/last visibility by season.

## Lore
Minor role in calendars and omen lists compared to Hex and Karodot; chiefly a teaching example for inner-orbit geometry.
