# Oboe (Primary Star)

## Physical
Sun-like yellow dwarf; steady output on human timescales.

## Observational / ritual
Temple ephemerides (starting around ~700 AO) and navigator-book sunrise tables anchor ritual hours, port operations, and convoy departures. “Conductor” in Good Old Rhythm metaphor.
