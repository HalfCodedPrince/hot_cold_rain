# Karodot (Gas Giant)

## Appearance & motion
Blue-white to the unaided eye. Long synodic period. Ring structure suspected historically; later images confirm a thin system. Many moons (“daughters”) in lore; the largest commonly called Sere-Karodot.

## Lore
Known as the “Old Hag” or “Bitch-Queen” of the sea in sailor legend — capricious, moody, and mother of many moons. Navigation proverbs and omens abound, though her supposed influence on weather is explicitly denied in modern teaching.
