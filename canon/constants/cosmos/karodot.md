# Karodot (Gas Giant)

## Appearance & motion
Blue-white to the unaided eye. Long synodic period. Ring structure suspected historically; later images confirm a thin system. Many moons (“daughters”) in lore; the largest commonly called Sere-Karodot.

## Lore
Sailor proverbs tie sea moods to Karodot (non-causal folklore historically).

## Iconic photo from 1797 AO.
A low-resolution three-filter additive composite from the earliest survey program; despite artifacts it set the canonical “teal-ringed” classroom image and remains widely reproduced.
