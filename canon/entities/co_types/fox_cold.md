## Scope
Taiga marts and winter road nets; beacon-corridor hubs.

## Morphology & Accent
Thicker ear bases; heat-conserving pelage; glare-veiling habits in snow seasons.

## Work & Ward
Long-road courier guilds; factor benches with winter dockets.

## Clothing Accents
Snow-glare veils; vented collars that close tight; ear-friendly hoods.

## Law & Etiquette
Identity rolls record **line+dialect** in fast-track cities; privacy fights continue elsewhere.
