## Scope
Urban-density variant clustered at beacon legs, bell-towers, and tall wards.

## Morphology & Accent
Stronger vestibular calm at height; typical Bat forelimb/membrane pattern with steadying micro-motions.

## Work & Ward
Beacons, bell-towers, signal access; trusted for high inspections and night runs.

## Clothing Accents
Wingsleeves with membrane-safe cuffs; shoulder cradles; **no armor aloft**.

## Law & Etiquette
Beacon ladders post aux patterns; fines for yanking wing seams; mixed courts recognize “membrane pinch” as tort.
