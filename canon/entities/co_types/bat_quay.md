## Scope
Dense port wards, packet lofts, rigging yards; short-hop specialists.

## Morphology & Accent
Shorter hop cadence; wind-hood familiarity; same manual thumb use as line standard.

## Work & Ward
Packet lofts, sealed-packet runs, quay signals; no armor aloft in any loft.

## Clothing Accents
Wind hoods, translucent veils on green-rain days; membrane oil tabs standard.

## Law & Etiquette
Loft rails marked membrane-safe; labor charters post fines-as-theatre for seam pulling and hood-yank.
