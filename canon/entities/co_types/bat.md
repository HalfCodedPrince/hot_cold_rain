Urban-density volant line for **night inspection & packet lofts**; standard kit is **wingsleeves, shoulder cradles**—**no armor aloft**.

## Morphology
Elongate forearm/digits II–V; flank-hip membrane; **manipulative thumbs** retained; night-tilted circadian; strong scotopic vision; vestibular finesse; excellent 3D spatial working memory.

## Health
Shoulder overuse; membrane tears; wind otitis; strict day-sleep routines. Sanctuary kits issue **ear wind-hoods**, **membrane oil/patch tabs**, and **tool harness** guidance.

## Dialects (ward splits)
**Tower-bat** (beacon legs, bell-towers; calmer at height); **Quay-bat** (short hops with wind-hoods; masts/rigging familiarity).

## Culture & Work
Night closures & inspection; sealed-packet lofts and bell/beacon access; mast signalling teams in ports.

## Law & Safety
Identity rolls treat **line+dialect** as administrative; **Mixed Court** oversees workplace kit audits. **Membrane-pinch** is a named tort; fines post on beacon legs.

## Clothing
**Wingsleeves** (membrane-safe cuffs); **shoulder cradles** to offload pectoral strain; **launch aids** (ledge straps/mast pegs); **no armor aloft**; formal: open-back half-capes that avoid pinch.
