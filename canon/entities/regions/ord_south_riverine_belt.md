## c.0 AO notes
- Canal gates and ferry chains define politics.  
- Harbor **collegia** appear where river meets sea; pilot-magistrates arbitrate weights and berths.  
- Goat and sheep move inland on levee crowns; kiln smoke marks towns.

**Matters later:** collegia habits evolve cleanly into the Council culture of Ord.
