## c.0 AO notes
- Processional ramps and river stairs bind civic life to tides.  
- Court arcades blend guild custom and shrine oath; **shell-bonds** travel up and down the coast.  
- Outriggers and shallow barges knit city belts; inland routes are river first, foot second.

**Matters later:** provides the **treaty-port** and **mixed-court** DNA Sar–Ord will scale.
