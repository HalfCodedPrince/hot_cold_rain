# Ord Iron Marshes
Acidic fen–mangrove mosaics with bog-iron extraction camps and penal works.

## Industry & penal works
- **Bog-iron camps → tatara blooms**; tilt hammers inland for bar iron.
- **Nitraries** on raised beds (urine/ash/earth) feed powder houses; edge-runner mills nearby.
- **Penal labor** rotates dredge loggers, peat cutters, and dyke crews.

## Hazards
- Acid fen rot; fever belts; Green-Year surges contaminate pans; Works keeps **storm curtains** on channels.

## Era touchpoints
- Powder, iron, and wick quotas spike with convoy wars; in pamphlet era, whistle-leafs target marsh graft.
