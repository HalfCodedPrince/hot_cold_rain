## c.0 AO notes
- Flood calendars run the farm and the dock.  
- Stepped sanctuaries double as refuges; choir embassies exchange **house-songs**.  
- Port causeways and gate piers charge **measure-stone** tolls.

**Matters later:** calendar prestige exports easily; terrace and causeway engineers get hired across the sea.

## Era touchpoints
- **North Kllrian** joins league (early 1400 c.); privateerization routinized under marque.
- **Choir diplomacy:** house-songs standardize treaty preambles; terrace engineers export causeway know-how.
- **Pamphlet era:** public Rhythm minimum; **Old Word** kept on terraces; presses tolerated if quiet.

## Economy & lanes
- Papers, paddy, lacquer, bast cordage, terrace stone; export **calendar prestige** with pilots and Works clerks.
