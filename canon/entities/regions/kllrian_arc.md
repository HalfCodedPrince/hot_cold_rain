## c.0 AO notes
- Flood calendars run the farm and the dock.  
- Stepped sanctuaries double as refuges; choir embassies exchange **house-songs**.  
- Port causeways and gate piers charge **measure-stone** tolls.

**Matters later:** calendar prestige exports easily; terrace and causeway engineers get hired across the sea.
