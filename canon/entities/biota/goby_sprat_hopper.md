## Habitat
Quay mudflats, reed margins, barge bilges along the beacon-forest corridor (Ord → Tau-Hi).

## Traits
- Enlarged pectoral fin rays act as **props** on wet stone.
- **Cutaneous air exchange** extended; tolerates strandings for short spells.
- Salt-film eyelids reduce surface glare; follows **green haze** scent trails.

## Use
- Bilge scavenger in print lofts and sump pits (controls “ink-gnats” & larvae).
- Kid-trapped for stew in poor wards.

## Risk
- Slippery step hazard during bloom spikes; clinic notes minor bite abrasions.
- **Temple/Plate** post no-harvest windows on mask days.

## Notes
Likely regulation shift + survival bias from repeated green years; no reproductive isolation observed.
