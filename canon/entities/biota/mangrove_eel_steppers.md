## Habitat
Brackish mud, culvert mouths, shaded masonry under storm galleries.

## Traits
Reinforced finfolds; extended **air-gulp endurance**; seeks stone shade.

## Use
Canal patrols prize them for **mosquito control**; still a festival skewer staple.

## Risk
Wedges into culvert grates; bites during night drain flushes—gloves advised.
