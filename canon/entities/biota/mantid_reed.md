## Habitat
Canal reeds, mangrove margins, shrine gardens.

## Traits
- Reed-mimic thorax; forelimb patch carries **green biofilm lure**.
- Startle flight reduced; prefers freeze-posturing in wind.

## Use
- Garden pest control; trained with scent cues in shrine yards.

## Risk
- **Percussion panic**: drums/horns near rookeries cause swarms; fines-as-theatre zones posted.
