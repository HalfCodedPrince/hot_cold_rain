## Overview
Koi-Hi sits at the storm-shadowed tail of Eastern Ord, a deepwater hinge on the Old Song lanes. By late precolonial centuries it is the **big book and hull** of the Bright Sea: charts and pilot-notes printed in rows, hulls caulked under lanterns, insurance written in back rooms that smell of salt and ink.

## Trajectory (high-level)
- **Early Imperial:** a second-tier port learning Ord pilotage and Rhythm rites.
- **Hexennial age:** choir colleges and compositories prosper; guild credit thickens; insurance houses appear.
- **Age of Discovery:** becomes the main outward port for southern Sar / Widiwidi voyages; forms the civic core of the **Longara Republic** (post-imperial).
- **By 1803 AO:** rusting brilliance—old slipways rot, new works cut cheap; still beautiful in the rain and neon of compository rows.

## District Notes
- **Outer Bar & Lantern Row** (harbor lights, fog bells).  
- **Compository Quarter** (licensed presses; hymn-leafs to pilot-books).  
- **Insurance Steps** (brokers’ arcades; convoy rate boards).  
- **Slipways** (old imperial cradles beside shabbier new rails).

## Legal & Cultural
Legacy **Coi-Hi** spelling persists on old pilot-books. City keeps a proud civic senate in the **Longara** era while licensing Rhythm rites for festivals and funerals.
