## One-line
Sar humanist and temple-rector who taught that **law should cleanse, not maim**; led **lustration marches**, printed the *Clean Water Dialogues*, attacked **Deafening** and **plate monopolies**, and built **refugee networks** from Tau-Hi to Morum.

## Profile
Seli preached geometry and baths: clean lines, clean hands, and **clean copies** open to marginal commentary. She loved choirs but not monopolies, and made the case that **mercy is cheaper** than blood.

## Timeline
- **1458** — Elected **Rector** of the **Tau-Hi Lyceum** (Works & Assay chairs court her).  
- **1463–1472** — Publishes the *Clean Water Dialogues* (lustrations, restitution over spectacle); stages **bath-house sermons** that travel as plays.  
- **1475** — Exiled after a Plate Warrant raid; flees with students to **Morum**; opens a soup-dock and a tiny press in a Gardens lean-to.  
- **1476–1490** — Organizes **Refugee Enclave Charters** in Sar ports and Free Cities; preaches calendars by water, not ports.  
- **1499** — Dies in Morum; last sermon urges dropping **Deafening** “so the Oboe can be heard.”

## Doctrines
- **Open Commentary:** Beat II may guard *modes*, not *monopoly*; recensions should carry margins for replies.  
- **Lustral Justice:** replace public maiming with **ritual restitution** (baths, bonds, rebuilding); public peace via **repair**, not terror.  
- **Water-set Calendars:** festivals should follow **basins**, not bench politics; inland rhythms matter.

## Style & Methods
- Processions from bath-steps to assay stalls; choruses alternating with **washings**; pamphlets in **dialogue form** (a clerk and a washerwoman).

## Adversaries
- Tamur Inqel (debates in absentia); Ord hard-liners; a few Sar elders who disliked her Free Cities/Crum allies.

## Quotable (diegetic)
> “The plate may set the pitch; the water sets the time.” — *Clean Water Dialogues*, Leaf V

## Hooks
- A watermark plate from her Morum press (a lotus inside the assay ring).  
- A “two-roof” marriage service she wrote for Ord–Knees couples.
