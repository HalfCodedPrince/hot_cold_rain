# Thesis
Finishes Harbor Watch rollouts; pushes court forms and metric stones to treaty ports.

## Matters later
Bureaucratic overgrowth begins here; later rulers inherit a heavier procedural state.

## Notes
Likely the **nephew seated in 827 AO** by Long-Beat presumption; canonize lineage once succession table is locked.
