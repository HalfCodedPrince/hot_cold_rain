## Summary
A middling **copper factor** who stamped his bars against newly posted **measure-stones**—but delivered undergrade stock to upriver buyers. Their bark-cloth complaints, countersigned by a **pilot-magistrate**, survive as a set text in port schools.

## Case notes (excerpt)
- **Defect**: slag inclusions; short weight; tampered corner cuts.  
- **Ruling**: threefold restitution; public posting at ferry stairs; right to mark his **seal-plate** “spoiled” for one flood cycle.  
- **After**: Nasir pivoted to **rope and oiled cloth**, quietly successful.

## Anecdota
Mocking dock verse: “**Salt-Step Nasir** sells rain for resin; buy his bars and you’ll buy the river too.”
