## One-line
Orthodox **Beat II** powerhouse who turned metrical purity into a **censorship machine**, co-authored the **Plate Warrants (1452)**, helped harden **Cleanliness Tables → Black Books (1492)**, and wrote large pieces of the **Green Skies Edicts (1503)**.

## Profile
Tamur was a choirmaster who discovered he preferred **ledgers to litanies**. He framed doctrine as **plate custody**: if **only singable law is lawful**, then **only sealed plates** make law singable. He allied with Beat VI (Discipline), courted the insurers, and learned to love forms.

## Timeline
- **1448** — Named **High Recensor**; begins numbering master plates; pressures compositories to emboss plate-IDs in margins.  
- **1452** — Pushes **Plate Warrants** through Ord benches: seizures target plates and presses, not stacks of paper.  
- **1471–1478** — Assists the **Oboe Packet** trials (postal monopoly pilots); begins inserting **reader roll** slips in packets to collegia.  
- **1492** — Brokers insurer cooperation to turn **Cleanliness Tables** into traveling **Black Books** (shared ban ledgers).  
- **1503** — Co-drafts the **Green Skies Edicts** (arts 1, 3, 4, 5); public face of “temporary” stamps and rolls.  
- **1507** — Dies at his desk; Beat II prints a black-bordered leaf with the plate numbers of his life’s run.

## Methods
- **Index by Meter:** declared off-meter recensions “unsafe” rather than heretical—a technical door to suppression.  
- **Seize the Means:** raids take **plates**; printers must beg rivals to run their jobs.  
- **Bureaucratize Mercy:** replaces **Deafening** with **Queue Loss** and **Stamp Arrears**—still cruel, just quieter.  
- **Network the Ban:** Steps and benches share ratings so a printer banned in Ord starves in Vitrana, too.

## Adversaries
- **Seli of the Lotus Baths**; Free Cities/Crum satirists; Knees vision-leaves; collegia bursars who hated reader rolls.

## Quotable (diegetic)
> “A city is a choir. The plate is its pitch. Do not let the pitch wander.” — preface to *On the Custody of Modes* (Beat II Platebook 18)

## Hooks
- The **Platebook 18** marginalia (surprisingly funny).  
- A rumor that he privately funded soup lines during the Green Years while stamping their pamphlets “D”.
