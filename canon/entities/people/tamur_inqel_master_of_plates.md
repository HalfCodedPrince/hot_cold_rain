## One-line
Orthodox **Beat II** powerhouse who turned metrical purity into a **censorship machine**, co-authored **Plate Warrants (1452)**, hardened **Cleanliness Tables → Black Books (1492)**, and wrote large pieces of the **Green Skies Edicts (1503)**.

## Profile
Framed doctrine as **plate custody**—if only singable law is lawful, sealed plates must rule print. Allied with **Beat VI** to turn technical purity into procedure.

## Timeline
- 1448 — Named **High Recensor**; begins numbering master plates; compositories emboss plate-IDs.  
- 1452 — **Plate Warrants** pass: raids seize plates/presses, not loose sheets.  
- 1471–1478 — Assists **Oboe Packet** trials (postal pilots); introduces **reader-roll** slips.  
- 1492 — Brokers insurer/Steps sharing to turn **Cleanliness Tables** into traveling **Black Books**.  
- 1503 — Co-drafts **Green Skies Edicts** (arts 1,3–5).  
- 1507 — Dies at desk; Beat II prints a black-bordered leaf listing his life’s plates.

## Methods
Index by meter (declare off-meter “unsafe”); seize plates; replace spectacle with queue/stamp penalties; network bans across Steps/benches.

## Adversaries
**Seli of the Lotus Baths**; Free City satirists; collegia bursars who hated reader rolls.
