## Summary
Led a winter-stalled overland push toward Ord during the **Battle of Mistakes** (518 AO): Wurran militia, palace-guard core, ~100 Klr’ian mercenaries, and battle-trained pincer crabs. Occupied several Ord-aligned towns; disease, supply failure, and **green-rain** seasons blunted the strike before Ord. The column failed when Ord’s militia and city guard caught it outside the walls.

## Notes
- Context: both fleets wrecked the same year by pollen haze + typhoon in Ord Bay.
