## Summary
Led a winter-stalled overland expedition toward Ord during the **Battle of Mistakes** (518 AO): Wurran militia, a palace guard core, ~100 Klr’ian mercenaries, and battle-trained pincer crabs. Advanced along the coast, occupied several Ord-aligned towns, but disease, supply failure, and green-rain conditions blunted the strike before Ord. Ultimately **doomed** when Ord’s militia/city guard met the army outside the walls.

## Notes
- Context: fleets on both sides wrecked by pollen haze + typhoon in Ord Bay (same campaign year).
