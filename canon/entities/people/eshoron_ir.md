## Summary
Eshoron Ir bridges temple and state: a patient organizer who turned a printed recension into a functioning civic rhythm. His tenure emphasized legal codification, choir training, and calendar harmonization across ports.

## Roles
- **Convenor, Editorial Circle** — chaired deliberations; resolved doctrinal disputes into singable, enforceable forms.  
- **Civic Integrator** — coordinated with courts and port magistracies to align festivals, tariffs, and work-rests with the calendar.

## Succession & Early Policies
Upon Zambran’s abdication/death in **726 AO**, Eshoron is confirmed High Master. Early acts: confirm temple licensing for **compositories**, formalize **Synod of Beats**, and publish the **civic rites schedule** for ports.

## Notes
Dates to be firmed when late-Zambranic succession table is finalized.
