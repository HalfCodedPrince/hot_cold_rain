## Summary
Kllrian-born, without the pedigree to win a normal vote; brought ~50 ships and a blunt creed: **spare not blood, but spare the empire**. He let rivals bleed each other, crushed the Seven Fingers fleet in the rain, and turned gray privateers into escorts.

## Regnal Beats
- **790/791 AO** — Oar-Bench Oath after Nerise’s vow and pact; elected on a “protection of the empire” emergency.
- **792–796 AO** — Harbor Watches unified (Ord Bay first); **Insurance Steps** bill drafted; Beacon Chain begun.
- **799 AO** — **Battle of the Emerald Shoals**: Seven Fingers fleet forced ashore in green rains; annihilated; captain captured.
- **800 AO** — Public trial in Ord; insult to captain’s wife compensated; treason sentence carried out—watershed for the Cadence.
- **821 AO** — Lost at sea off Sar; **Empty Seat** (no body); presumed dead in **827**.
