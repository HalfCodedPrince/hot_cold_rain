## Summary
Zambran is the consolidation-era High Master who redirected imperial energy from frontier crisis management to durable civic integration. He did not “write” the Rhythm, but he made it law: bankrolling presses, forcing circulation to harbors and courts, and anchoring the calendar in daily life.

## Regnal Beats
- **673 AO** — Elected High Master during the Kahet raids; establishes a fortified **camp-city** on the marches.  
- **674–679 AO** — **Kahet Settlement** by tribute, arbitration, and hostage trade; frontier stabilized.  
- **701 AO** — **Ord–Sar** union formalized after sieges, blockades, and Sar city-faction alignments.  
- **c. 705 AO** — First printed **Old Bold Rhythm** (temple leafs + harbor packets) circulates empire-wide.  
- **c. 722 AO** — **Civic adoption** of the Rhythm calendar & rites (ports first; inland by decree).  
- **726 AO** — Abdication/death; succession of **Eshoron Ir**.

## Authorship & Patronage (Disputed)
Court ledgers and temple minutes show **Eshoron Ir** convened the editorial circle; **Nasha of Tau-Hi**, **Kelim Ar**, and **Teyu the Grey** compiled and redacted. **Zambran** funded presses, compelled distribution, and mandated civic adoption.

## Iconography & Anecdota
- **Unibrow of Unity**; satirists exaggerate it.  
- **“Zambran’s Salad”** tavern lore.  
- **Never held a boarding axe**; captains did.  
- **The Oar-Bench Throne**: sworn upon the thwart; otherwise kept empty in sessions.
