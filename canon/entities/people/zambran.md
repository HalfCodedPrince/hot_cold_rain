### Authorship & Patronage (Disputed)

Tradition credits **Zambran** with “writing” the Old Bold Rhythm. Court ledgers and temple minutes show a different picture: 
**Eshoron Ir** convened the editorial circle; **Nasha of Tau-Hi**, **Kelim Ar**, and **Teyu the Grey** compiled and redacted; **Zambran** bankrolled presses, forced distribution to harbors, and ordered the calendar’s civic adoption.

### Key Regnal Beats (adjusted)

- **673 AO** — Elected High Master during the Kaheet raids. Establishes a fortified “camp-city.”  
- **674–679 AO** — The Kaheet Settlement: tribute, hostages, trade posts; raids cease.  
- **701 AO** — **Ord–Sar** formalized (alliance/subjugation after decades of sieges, blockades, and city-faction politicking).  
- **c. 705 AO** — First printed **Old Bold Rhythm** in circulation (temple leafs + harbor packets).  
- **c. 722 AO** — Civic adoption of the **Rhythm calendar & rites** across imperial ports.  
- **726 AO** — Abdication/Death (choose one in the era file).

### Iconography & Anecdota

- **The Unibrow of Unity**: official busts and coins render Zambran with a continuous brow, a visual pun on “unity” and “one line.” Satirical works later exaggerate it.  
- **“Zambran’s Salad”**: a goat-cheese and greens dish reputedly served in the Kaheet camp-city; tavern lore insists it is inauthentic and overpriced.  
- **Never Held an Axe**: contemporaries agree he was a poor singer and never swung a boarding axe in anger (or otherwise); his captains did.
