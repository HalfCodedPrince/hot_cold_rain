## One-line
Pragmatist High Master who turned pirates into revenue, benches into schedules, and cousins into a **Kin-Grove**, then midwifed the **Great Ord–Sar Principality** (1304).

## Profile
A ledger mind with a dramatist’s sense of spectacle, Camra Dona understood that **paper without ports is noise**. He married Ord’s benches to insurers and Works, married **Electors to Dona kin**, and married **fear to profit** (Mangrove Ordinance + Morum Exchange). Not a conqueror; a *co-opter*.

## Timeline
- **1287** — Elected **High Master of Ord** after a bruising bench contest; marries into the **Tau-Hi Archon** line.  
- **1289–1291** — Backs pilots who chart the first **all-returns** windows to **Widiwidi**; insurers post **Rate-Holds**.  
- **1295** — Orchestrates the **Mangrove Ordinance** (crab death for piracy on escorted lanes).  
- **1296** — Licenses the **Morum Exchange Ordinance** (Assay + Duty + Docket for captured goods not from Rate-Hold convoys).  
- **1297** — Opens a two-festival **War Stair** to fund pirate-hunts by pirates themselves and marque compacts.  
- **1298** — Brokers **Seven Fingers parity charter**; seals it with a Dona-to-Archon marriage.  
- **1299–1302** — Leans blockade + amnesty to pull **North Kllrian** into the confederacy.  
- **1304** — Chairs the **Great Conference at Ord**; proclaims the **Great Ord–Sar Principality**; establishes the **Access Days Board** as arbiter.  
- **1309** — Dies of fevered relapse; succeeded by nephew **Eidon Dona** (PERS:DONA-002), a competent but lesser light.

## Policies & Tools
- **Carrot & Stick at Sea:** Mangrove executions *and* a legal fence (CGWs) for stolen goods that avoid protected lanes.  
- **Access First:** Convoys as calendars; **priority** traded for obedience.  
- **Kin-Grove:** Dynastic marriages to each Elector within two festivals of accession.  
- **Bench Theater:** highly public dockets, Cleanliness tables, and show trials aimed at accountants as much as mobs.

## Quotable (diegetic)
> “When paper finds a bell and a lantern, it becomes law. Make a bell. Hang a lantern.” — marginal note in a bench copybook (Ord Archive Leaf 1296.IV)

## Hooks
- A private letter to the Tau-Hi Archon on the cost of mercy.  
- The pocket whistle he used to time Access hearings (he carried it everywhere).
