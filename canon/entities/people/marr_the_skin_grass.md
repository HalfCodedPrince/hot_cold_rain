## Summary
Nephew-favorite of **Zambran**, Marr rose on intrigue and emergency. Early competence gave way to appetites, humiliations and petty cruelties (flies on pins), then to vanity architecture and ritual purges. He empowered censors, slighted captains, and taught tributary ports that the center would not bite.

## Regnal Beats
- **746 AO** — **Tammis Ardan** dies by poison; Marr implicated in whispers.  
- **747 AO** — Elected High Master; hands the levers to **Council** and **Synod**, plays patron.  
- **755 AO** — Villa scandals (captains and their wives); first big wave of **censures & book burnings**.  
- **762 AO** — **Reed-Camp Rising**; garrisons slide into rackets.  
- **767 AO** — Creates the **Censor’s Bench** to license recensions and seize “heretical” leafs.  
- **771 AO** — Burns “imperfect” palace works; rebuilds at ruinous cost.  
- **783 AO** — **Vanishes** between night and tide; searches and temple lots called; no body recovered.

## Why “Skin-Grass”?
1) **Taxman’s Quip:** “He skins even grass”—petty fees from nothing.  
2) **Green Rot:** stores ruined under his watch (green rain), “the skin of grass over grain.”  
3) **Pamphleteers’ Pun:** a choir joke about the smell, reportedly due to disease.

## Anecdota & Rumor
- **Sea-lion councillor:** apocryphal pamphlet trope.  
- **Flies on spikes:** multiple contemporaries confirm.  
- **Consort politics:** early strong listener-consort; later purged from minutes.  
- **Last Swim:** guard chatter claims a night swim the week of disappearance; bulletins denounce “sea-omens.”
