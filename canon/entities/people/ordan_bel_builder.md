## Summary
Turned surplus into structure: contiguous **beacon legs**, **Slipway Standard Mk II**, deep-draft cuts—financed via **Debt Office** bonds keyed to festival cycles. It worked until storms + stacked maturities met thin treasuries.

## Program highlights
- Slipway Mk II rollout in Ord Bay and Sar capes.  
- **Debt calendars** synchronized to Hexennial sets (ease collections; hide rollovers).  
- Port **measure-stones** re-faced; tariff boards standardized.

**Matters later:** hardware durability + **duration creep** → brittle when revenues dip.
