## Summary
Ordan Bel turned surplus into structure: continuous **beacon legs**, **Slipway Standard Mk II**, and deep-draft cuts. He financed via **Debt Office** bonds keyed to festival cycles. It worked—until storms and stacked maturities met thin local treasuries.

## Program Highlights
- **Slipway Mk II** rollout in Ord Bay and major Sar capes.  
- **Debt calendars** synchronized to Hexennial sets (ease collections, hide rollovers).  
- **Port metrology stones** re-faced; tariff boards standardized.

**Matters later:** durable hardware + **duration creep** → brittle when revenues dip.
