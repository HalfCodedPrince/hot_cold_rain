## Summary
Niece-line relative of Zambran and matron of a solvent captain clan. When the Council dithered, Nerise used cash, choir, and carefully aimed terror to restart state functions—then bound her alliance to the outsider admiral with a **marriage pact** and a public **Vow of the Long Breath**.

## Regnal/Political Beats
- **789–790 AO** — Rallies creditors and loyal crews; stages docks confrontation; vow under Oboe; **marriage pact** with the admiral (unconsummated).
- **792–796 AO** — Harbor Watches standardized; **Beacon Chain (Ord Bay)** begun; censorate warrants fenced under Beat Six rules.
- **800 AO** — Calendar & Measures Circular signed; Hexennial “unity” set goes empire-standard.
- **821–827 AO** — Holds order during the admiral’s **Empty Seat**; in **827** yields the Oboe Seal to her nephew per Long Beat rule.
- **830 AO** — Dies childless; libels about the triad (with her brother/admiral) are later dismissed as rival hit-pieces.
