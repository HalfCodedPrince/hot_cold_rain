## Summary
A dock-courtyard lecturer who taught **“count, then believe.”** His **tide-and-Hex leafs** became the seed of later Sar almanacs. Temple readers tolerated him; guild factors funded him when it paid.

## Apocrypha (popular, not proved)
- **“Hex Year of Green”**: supposedly predicted a run of pollen-bright nights, buying dye vats early and selling dear.  
- **Water clock**: a dripping jar with reed marks timed choir drills and ferry queues.

## Notes
Later commentators in the **Tau-Hi Lyceum** cite him as a proto-method man, even when disagreeing with his cosmology.
