# Summary
Niece-line Zambran and solvent **captain-clan** matron. When the Council stalled, Nerise used cash, choir, and selective terror to restart state functions—then bound her alliance to the outsider admiral with a **marriage pact** and public **Vow of the Long Breath**.

## Political beats
- **789–790 AO** — Rallies creditors & crews; docks confrontation; Oboe **vow**; *marriage pact* with the admiral (unconsummated).  
- **792–796 AO** — Harbor Watches standardized; **Beacon Chain (Ord Bay)** begun; Censorate fenced under Beat Six warrants.  
- **800 AO** — Calendar & Measures Circular signed; Hexennial “unity” set goes empire-standard.  
- **821–827 AO** — Holds order during the admiral’s **Empty Seat**; in **827** yields the Oboe Seal per Long-Beat rule.  
- **830 AO** — Dies childless; contemporary libels about a “triad” later discounted as rival hit-pieces.
