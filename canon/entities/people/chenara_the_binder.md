## Summary
A high priest turned **Canal-Warden**, Henara fused a chain of temple-cities with oaths sworn on **measure-stones** and flood calendars. He minted no coin; his **shell-bonds** and hostage-surety knit the arc for one hard generation.

## Program (c. -078 → -064 AO)
- **Canal levies** raised by terrace quotas; causeway tolls unified.  
- **Choir embassies** rotate between sanctuaries; flood/oath days harmonized.  
- **Passage guarantees** exchanged with South-Ord pilot-magistrates in bad monsoon years.

## Collapse
After his death, raider cliques from the taboo isles (“**eel-people**” in later pamphlets) harried the causeways. City elders defaulted to local seals; tribute schedules failed; the league unraveled within two flood cycles.

## Anecdota
- Insignia: reed-coil crook; flood-gauge staff.  
- Later **conspiracy broadsides** claim he was poisoned by dye-house creditors; no proof survives.
