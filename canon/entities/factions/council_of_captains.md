## Overview
The Council began as a harbor collegium of ship-masters and became the republic’s executive spine. It **calls elections** for the High Master, steers convoy policy, and posts Captain-Representatives to sensitive ports.

## Procedures (excerpt)
- **Elections:** motion by majority; proclamation when death is proved or the **Edict of the Long Beat** applies.
- **Emergencies:** “war dockets” enable accelerated orders; require Beat Six countersign for arrests/proscriptions.
- **Convoys:** pool/route approvals; insurance standards published to compositories and port courts.

### Chamber & Seat
Sessions meet in the **Salt Chamber**. The High Master’s **Oar-Bench Throne** (see `systems/governance/symbols_of_office.md`) sits centered and usually empty; captains take benches by ward, clerks stand.

## Notes
During the **Empty Seat**, the Council holds one of the **Three Seals** (fleets & writs). Its prestige suffered in the Marrite years for inaction against defecting ports.
