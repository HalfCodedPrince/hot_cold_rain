## Overview
High spurs and knife valleys north of the Ord rim, with cold fog sliding down to the **Stern**. Terrace cities work water like coin; passes and fords decide seasons and wars. Markets run on oath-stones; Rhythm minimum only at gates.

## Passes & Fords
- **Kahet Gates:** first all-season ford below the crest; switchback road; toll houses with oath-basins.
- **Winter roads:** frozen marsh belts open beyond the crest; **pack trains** replace carts; storm sheds cribbed by Works lists.
- **Stone-rooms:** terrace archives of vows and water shares; cases re-read at festival.

## Era touchpoints (1200–1400)
- **1306–1308:** head-silver takes a charismatic upland leader; successor accepts a Dona marriage; **Ord-Kahet** chartered just south of the Stern shore—nucleus of **Too-Kahet**.
- **Charter peace:** **Concordat of Three Gates**—terrace courts keep private rite if fairs and oaths keep time; Rhythm minimum at gates only.
- **Green Years:** avalanches and washouts sever passes; Works buys cribbing; fish failures push terrace crews into quay work further south.

## Law & Rite
- **Stone-Current / Old Word** in terraces; oath-stones settle trade; southern benches accept stone vows at gates during festival windows.
- **Rhythm minimum:** calendar, charity, oaths honored in market week; doctrine stays uphill.

## Goods & Lanes
Bloom iron, slate, hardwood, wax, bast, pearls upriver; salt, tools, cloth, paper down. Convoys touch **Ord-Kahet**; inland lanes are **pack & punt**.
