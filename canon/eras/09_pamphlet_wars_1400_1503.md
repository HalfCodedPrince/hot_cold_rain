## Era thesis
Cheap paper, convoy-safe travel, and a literate craft class ignite a century of **pamphlet wars** over text, tune, and power. The conflict starts as print and theater; escalates to **boycotts, dock riots, pogroms, assassinations**; and ends under a green sky (1503), when emergency **Green Edicts** fuse benches, Steps, and Works into a single reachy machine. “Old Bold Rhythm” survives—rebranded as the **Good Old Rhythm**—but only after losing purity and gaining police.

## Heat map (how hot, where)
- **Ord core (HOT):** bench/temple city; Beat II (Text) vs compositories; **student & dock riots** common; targeted murders of Beat VI clerks; deafening becomes rare but symbolic.
- **Tau-Hi / Sar littoral (WARM):** humanist **Sea-Lotus** push; **lustration marches**, theater polemics; limited arrests; lots of print.
- **Seven Fingers / Koi-Hi / Vitrana / Morum (WARM):** ports fight via **boycotts** and **Access Days leverage**; theater sacks, pamphlet seizures, one or two notable assassinations.
- **Knees (SPORADIC, WEIRD):** **Reed visions** and silences; step-dance processions; a few ecstatic cult panics; limited bloodshed.
- **Kllrian uplands (LOW):** public minimum; private Stone-Current intact; pamphlets circulate but violence is mostly imported.
- **Free Cities (LOUD, CAGEY):** **satyr plays** and fines instead of brands; press is wild; fighters are mercenaries, not mobs.
- **Northlands & Stern marts (LOW):** fog marts host **samizdat routes**; violence rare—ports just close the gate.

## Factions (broad strokes)
- **Orthodox Beats**: Beat II (Text & Music) + Beat VI (Discipline), pro-monopoly on recensions; want bench-police.
- **Splendid Word**: syncretic preachers, Free Cities printers, Sar humanists; want open plates, local calendars, mercy law.
- **Kin-Grove**: cousins around the Oboe Seal; want control of bursaries, Access Days, and Steps.
- **Steps & Insurers**: want peace on lanes; will fund both sides to keep premiums flat.
- **Works & Yards**: want budgets and predictable tenders; will back the winner.

## Arc in three beats
1. **1400–1430 (Ink & Stage):** Collegia pressrooms boom; **lampoon cycles** and **choir duels**; first **printer raids**; Steps float “Cleanliness Tables” for pamphlets (ratings, not bans).
2. **1431–1475 (Street & Docks):** boycott waves; **Access Days weaponized**; **burning of theathers**; a handful of **assassinations** (Beat clerks, star preachers, one insurer); refugee trickle begins.
3. **1476–1503 (Storm & Fear):** Green-belt anomalies return; fish crashes; bread spikes; **dock fights to pogrom edges**; **Refugee Enclave Charters** appear; on the **Day of Green Skies (1503)** a convocation passes the **Green Edicts** (emergency centralization).

## Refugees (vectors & enclaves)
- **Ord→Sar & Free Cities**: printers, students, “Splendid Word” clergy; settle around **Lotus Baths** and **Crum Assemblies**.
- **Knees diaspora**: Reed-dance houses in Free Cities & Vitrana.
- **To Widiwidi / Southern Sar**: port exiles; found **Charter Enclaves** under Company-Type (Co-Type) contracts.
- **Kllrian “quiet exits”**: terrace scholars to Ord-Kahet and Stern marts; keep Old Word alive in **Stone Rooms**.

## Outcomes by 1503
- **The Good Old Rhythm** (rebranded): keeps the six houses but accepts **open commentary** on recensions; loses Deafening; gains **discipline police** embedded with benches.
- **Principality**: passes **Green Edicts**—identity rolls, convoy acts, postal monopoly, censor plates, emergency fee-farms, Co-Type charters; claim is “to keep the Peace & Access.” Reality is **reach**.
