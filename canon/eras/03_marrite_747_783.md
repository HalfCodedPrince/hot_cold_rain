status: Draft
thesis: A competent captain-politician ascends on a clouded murder, then drifts into vice, censorship and vanity works; cohesion frays as ports test imperial will—fertile ground for the next consolidation.

## Overview
Marr “the Skin-Grass” inherits a humming machine (presses, calendar, measures) and a wary council. The early years look steady - raids deterred, convoys moving - but the facade crumbles. Marr retreats into private cruelties and public spectacles, censors the Compositories and choirs, and starves the dull gears of patrol, garrison and pay. A slighted captain uses a posting to **Seven Fingers** to carve his own fief; other ports learn the lesson. By the end, the empire still “chugs” on habit and paperwork, but the waterline is full of leaks.

## Phases
- **747–754: Arrival & Routine.** Calm seas, confident ledgers; Council and Synod handle the state while Marr curries popularity and patronage.
- **755–761: The Villa Years.** Scandals (captains’ wives), petty humiliations, and censorship edicts; Marr loses interest in flesh and pivots to architecture.
- **762–771: Frays & Fires.** **Reed-Camp Rising** (ore camp revolt); Seven Fingers’ “representative” goes native; **Censor’s Bench** created; palace projects burned and rebuilt.
- **772–783: Sullen Drift.** Patrols become rackets; tributaries stall payments; city militias bully garrisons; Marr spirals into paranoia and ritual purges.

## Systems Impact
- **Governance:** The **Council of Captains (FAC:COC-001)** looks compromised—first for abetting Marr’s accession, then for failing to discipline their own. **Synod of Beats (FAC:SYN-001)** expands arbitration but loses moral high ground under state censorship.
- **Economy:** Grain notes still clear, but delays mount; convoy pooling becomes a mask for under-funded escorts; privateers proliferate near the bar.
- **Culture & Print:** The **Censor’s Bench (FAC:CEN-001)** licenses recensions and authorizes seizures; presses work, but nervously.
- **Public Works:** The **Office of Imperial Works (FAC:ARC-001)** drains coin on prestige piles; slipways and beacons wait for repairs that never come.

## Chronology
- **746 AO** — High Master **Tammis Ardan** poisoned; scandal hints at a Sar slave “gift” from Marr’s ship; slave found dead, tongue cut.  
- **747 AO** — Emergency war docket opens; **Marr elected High Master**. Popular at first; routine governance left to Council & Synod.  
- **755 AO** — Villa scandals; captains paraded and mocked; pamphlets censored, then burned.  
- **758 AO** — A powerful **Captain-Representative** posted to **Seven Fingers**; within years, he rules it in fact.  
- **762 AO** — **Reed-Camp Rising** (ore camp revolt); loyal captains put it down, but garrisons start selling “protection.”  
- **767 AO** — **Censor’s Bench** created to license recensions and police Compositories and choirs.  
- **771 AO** — **Palace Fires**: Marr condemns “imperfect” works to burning; architects resign or flee.
- **776 AO** — Seven Fingers’ independence made plain; no punitive fleet sails. Tributaries elsewhere begin to “forget” schedules.
- **783 AO** — **The Vanishing of Marr**: the High Master is “not found” at palace, villa, or works. City sealed; harbors watched; no body recovered.
- **789 AO** — **Edict of the Long Beat**: after one Long Beat without proof (six years), offices may treat Marr as deceased for succession and contracts.
