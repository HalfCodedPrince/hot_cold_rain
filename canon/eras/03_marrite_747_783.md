## Thesis
From emergency election to paranoia: censorship and villa excesses break norms; coin and convoy discipline sag; the interregnal machinery (“Empty Seat”) is stress-tested.

## Overview
- Accession rhetoric vs. governance reality.
- Censor’s Bench remit and instruments.
- Convoy delays; coin debasement cycles.

## Key transitions → Era-04
- Vanishing of Marr; presumption edict; succession procedures.
- First mass festival politics as pressure valve.
