## Arc in three beats
1) **The Flicker (1050–1090)**: Silt returns faster than budgets; beacon outages “temporary”; festival finance games; claims courts still work if logs are clean.  
2) **The Dim Lantern (1098–1102)**: wrecks, denied claims, Steps riots; council inquiries expose stacked paper; a brief reform ministry stalls.  
3) **The Pass Choke (1120s)**: upland confeds choke passes; treaty ports renegotiate; Captain-Reps “for the duration” assume police powers they never return.

## Social Texture
- Relief kitchens boom under House Five; House Four pushes harbor missions; Beat Six docket swells with “public safety” warrants.  
- Printer guilds hedge bets; some rows burn “by accident” during unrest.  
- Choir tournaments downsize; Hexennial crowds sour; pamphlet wars bloom.

## Outcomes by 1200 AO
- Port belt still sings the Rhythm but loyalty is **transactional**.  
- Council’s prestige = **paper without teeth** beyond the bay.  


**Leads into:** Free Cities paralysis on the Ord side; Contract Ports along Sar; later religious-political fractures set the stage for Mutation Day centuries on.
