## Thesis
Printed catechisms and codes, convoy/harbor standards, and managed tributaries transform alliances into durable imperial governance.

## Overview
- Scripture/edict printing; editorial circles; licensing.
- Ord–Sar Union mechanics (blockade, arbitration, hostage practices).
- Office formation: Debt, Grain, Bench; seal rituals.
- High Master holds perpetual “maritime emergency.” Council still controls credit/hulls.
- Sar cities keep law/culture; Kllrian priest-kings rule locally if grain + rites + garrison.
- Units built from ship crews; captains → ship-masters → elected fleet masters (5y, paired).
- Planned but stalled reform: paid marines, levy quotas by port tonnage, centralized arsenal.

## Key transitions → Era-03
- Succession vulnerabilities; concentration of censorial tools.
- Factions around the high seat.
