# ERA-700 — Zambranic Ascendancy (700–800 AO)
ID: ERA:700

## Thesis
Zambran’s late reign and two brief successors mark the first imperial zenith: standardized fleets, tributary web, exploration runs. Old Song is unusually steady this century. The era ends under Marr—fiscal panic and stalled reform.

## Map Anchors
- REG:ORD-BAY (core), REG:KLR-ARC (granary), REG:SAR-NORTH (tributaries), REG:ORD-WEST (coerced peninsulas), REG:WID-LEE (rumored landfall).

## Institutions
- High Master holds perpetual “maritime emergency.” Council still controls credit/hulls.
- Sar cities keep law/culture; Kllrian priest-kings rule locally if grain + rites + garrison.

## Tech Base
- Reed-keel galleys; lateen auxiliaries; horn/whistle codes; lamp shutters.
- Sewer v3 in Ord; iron fittings tinned; arsenals issue standardized kits.

## Military Posture
- Units built from ship crews; captains → ship-masters → elected fleet masters (5y, paired). 
- Planned but stalled reform: paid marines, levy quotas by port tonnage, centralized arsenal.

## Culture
- Sar elite culture dominant in courts; dawn oboe rites public.
- Better port living standards; inland uneven.

## Beats (see timeline CSV)
- Zambran accession; Kllrian pact; Sewer v1 failure / v3 success; signal code; Tau-Hi submission; Widiwidi landfall; two short reigns; Marr; convoy insurance panic.
