## Era Thesis
After the **Great Conference at Ord (1304)**, the sea quiets only by halves. The **Great Ord–Sar Principality** gives merchants schedules and pirates a fence; then its knots tighten—marriages, benches, and bonds. Trade fattens, cities grow, and learning finds a room with shutters. But kin-politics, soft corruption, church fracture, and the **Green Years** (late-century storm cycles) begin to rot the ropes. By 1400 the lanterns still burn—and they hiss.

---

## Political Map (who holds what)

### Principality core
- **Post-conference drift back to bickering.** The **Diet** sits, Access Days are arbitrated, but Electors fight on paper and in colonies. **War Stairs** run short and rare; most violence is contractual.
- **Knees (late accession).** Last of the major Sar city-states to join, reading the room after **South Kllrian**’s collapse; rewarded with an **Elector seat** and parity at the Sar reef-cut—on paper. In practice, they muscle westward into archipelagos.

### Northlands (Ordward side)
- **East of Kahet — Ord-Kahet.** A charismatic upland confederate rises, then loses his head to an **Oboe Seal purse** from a “concerned” Emperor **Camra Dona**. His successor accepts a **Dona marriage** and an **Ord-style charter port** north of the Kahet range: **Ord-Kahet**. This becomes the **Too-Kahet** state’s core.
- **Central/Western uplands.** River-source petty kingdoms supplying the **Free Cities** with timber, hides, iron, and trouble. Faiths are **totemic/shamanic**; trousers are worn (to everyone’s scandalous amusement). Chronic border feuds, ritual ceasefires at festivals.

### Westward push
- **Knees** and richer **Free Cities** towns colonize **western Ord peninsulas** and **outer archipelagos** (wetlands/tropical rainforests). Poorer towns follow as refugees. New reefs, new fees.

## Lanes, Colonies, and Firsts

- **Widiwidi elbows.** **Kllrian** houses and **Seven Fingers** crowd into Widiwidi supply contracts (sulfur, pozzolan, iron-sand, bast). Skirmishes are common but usually end in **Prize Dockets** and **rate uplifts**, not sackings.
- **Sar inland expeditions.** Delta-rich **Tau-Hi** bankrolls river-inland probes; cordage and lacquer plantations push a day’s march inland where disease allows.
- **North Ord coast** mapped in segments by pilot chorus houses (windward lee rules copied into the **Rate-Hold Books**).
- **First circumnavigation (1376).** The **Reef-Back Circuit**: a compact out of **Ord–Koi-Hi–Morum** makes the long ring in four festival windows. Returns with good hulls and better stories; insurers stop calling it a myth.

---

## Governance & Economy (how the machine hums)

- **Access Days Board** (Koi-Hi) sets convoy calendars; **split tallies** and dyed lanyards keep priority honest. Bribery lives in **queue jumps**, not in forged tokens (that’s minting fraud).
- **Mangrove Ordinance** remains live: hit a **Rate-Hold** convoy, forge lantern/flag kits, or cleanse protected marks → **crab death**.
- **Cleansed goods** flow through **Factors’ Row** and licensed **Mangrove Gardens**; captains hand the paper to brokers and drink while fees and dockets settle. (The fence is the market.)
- **Nepotism (“Kin-Maze”).** Dona kin tie every Elector; Access Days *seem* to bend for cousins. Steps post **Cleanliness Tables** (assay, grade variance, complaints) each festival to keep corruption tolerable, not total.

---

## Cities, Culture, and Learning

### Urbanization & taste
Relative stability grows **fatter wards**: more glass, tiled roofs, and theater lamps; more trash and debt, too.

### Collegia (universities, chartered c.1310→)
- **Model:** Early-European *collegium* crossed with guild house. Charters from benches and compacts; **rector** elected by masters, **bursar** by merchants.
- **Faculties:**  
  - **Pilotry & Hydrology** (star paths, lee science, convoy discipline)  
  - **Works & Materials** (pozzolan, timber, iron-sand)  
  - **Assay & Account** (charge-and-discharge, metrology, fee-farms)  
  - **Song & Law** (temple music, bench-procedure, the public peace)  
  - **Arts & Stage** (choral drama, lanterncraft, pamphlet rhetoric)
- **Notables:** **Ord Collegium (1315)**; **Tau-Hi Lyceum (1322)**; **Koi-Hi Pilot Hall (1333)**.

### Theaters & Gardens
- **Rowdier playhouses** cluster beside **Mangrove Gardens** (“houses of easy dockets”). The famous tragedy **The Reef and the Hearth** plays two endings: *country* during the Last War retrospectives, *heart* after.

---

## Church & Confession (still cracking)
- **Synod Melody declared Discordant (1343).** Northern benches decry Ord-leaning doctrine; Tau-Hi hedges.  
- **Deafening Edicts (c.1331→).** Ritual **“deafening”** (liquid gold poured into ears) used on heresiarchs; technically a death sentence, politically a warning.  
- **Pamphlet weather gathers.** Collegia pressrooms teach rhetoric; leaf wars will explode next century.

---

## Environment & “Green Years”
- **Green belts (1389–1397)** bring bumper algae, storm belts, and fish failures; reefs shift under silt and bloom.  
- **Premium shocks** hit coastal fisheries; **Fishery Bans** by Access Days Board rotate closures; **Green-Scrip** trials pay crews to mend quays and haul weed instead of netting barren water.

---

## People & Succession
- **Camra Dona’s successor** is capable but not mythic. The alliance holds by **convenience + kin**, not genius. Every Elector is a cousin, and every cousin wants a staircase.

---

## Failure Modes (slow trouble)
- **Kin-capture:** Access calendars tilt; fee-farms pledged twice to cousins with bad paper.  
- **“A little murder.”** Seasonal piracy persists under the wink—until premiums spike and the clean hands come down.  
- **Bench wars by proxy:** Colonial skirmishes masquerade as **Prize law** and **Rate-Hold resets**.  
- **Clerical vendettas:** Deafening scares speakers into exile; homilies grow quiet; factions embed in collegia.

---

## Outcomes by 1400
- **Networked sea.** Koi-Hi, Vitrana, Morum, Ord, Tau-Hi sit on bonded stock, assay, and loud theaters. Moving between them no longer means dying.  
- **Paper confidence.** CGWs, Access tallies, and Rate-Hold books make a predictable market—until storms or synods say otherwise.  
- **Hairline fractures.** Church, nepotism, and fish lay cracks under the tiled floors; the next century will pour ink into them.
