## Overview (student paragraph)
Among the isles of the Bright Sea, Cuzhar Krum knit a trade network whose lifeline was tin from Ord’s uplands. Their cities raised stepped ritual complexes at tidal edges, recorded agreements on clay and elite verse on crab shells, and timed voyages to seasonal winds. A cluster of eruptions and storm decades broke the routes; the archipelago emptied, leaving half-sunken stairs and reef-grown courtyards.

## Big levers
- **Economy**: Tin-for-bronze exchanges; reef harbors; pilot lore guarded by guilds.
- **Religion**: Sun–sea rites; wind-pipes; funerary shell-script.
- **Tech**: Bronze elite kit; robust timber shipbuilding; stone quays.
- **Politics**: City league; priest-captains arbitrate trade quarrels.

## Overview (bullet points; keep concrete)
- Geography of the Bright Sea archipelagos; reef channels; seasonal winds.
- Krum’s exchange goods; temple schools; early ledgers and pilot lore.
- Environmental cascade and abandonment patterns; “Ash Years”.

## Key transitions → next era
- Pilotage and charts preserved in coastal sanctuaries.
- Survivors anchor proto-Ord settlements.
