name: Golden Cadence (Apex)
span: 860–1050 AO
status: Draft
thesis: Forms preserved, performance perfected—convoys assured, beacons lit, choirs in time. Prosperity spreads along the waterline even as the costs and contradictions that will crack the empire quietly accumulate.

## Overview
After the Nerise Zambranin-Kllrian restoration, a generation of **proceduralists** governs: elections occur on cue, the Oar-Bench pageant binds crowds to forms, and the empire becomes an **assurance machine**. Harbor Watches link bars to headlands; insurance tables price risk; compositories flood ports with uniform calendars and measures. Wealth thickens in ring-cities (Ord Bay, Koi-Hi, Tau-Hi), and scholarship blooms in temple colleges and printer-guild schools. Inland remains thin—but quiet.

## Phase sketch
- **860–900: The Standardizers.** Port-by-port replication: watch posts, beacon legs, court forms, recital canons; Seven Fingers Accords exported to other wavering ports.
- **900–980: The Financiers.** Public Debt Office underwrites beacons & dredges; copperplate chart schools rise; convoy assurance becomes near-universal.
- **980–1050: The Curators.** Big festivals go imperial format; censorship policed by warrant (narrow but real); city oligarchies knit into cartels. Everything works—until a shock.

## Systems impact (what the era does best)
- **Governance:** Council keeps elections; Beat Six routinizes warrants; Keeper’s registry is dull (by design).  
- **Economy:** Grain notes stable; **Convoy Insurance Office** turns risk into price; **Public Debt Office** floats beacons/dredges; **Harbor Watches** certify hours.  
- **Transport:** Copperplate pilot-books; staged night entries; slipway standards; limited inland roads, but **water-first** remains doctrine.  
- **Religion & Culture:** Rhythm goes civic: choirs arbitrate calendars, not doctrine; Hexennial set unifies festivals; compositories teach literacy-by-doing.  
- **Tech & Knowledge:** Wood-press perfected; copperplate engraving for charts; tide/almanac tables; improved fore-and-aft rigs, shallow-draft proas, better caulking resins.

## Seeds of decline (baked in by 1050 AO)
- **Maintenance burden:** Beacon/seawall/dredge upkeep outpaces local revenues; Debt Office rolls notes forward → duration creep.  
- **Cartelization:** Insurers, compositories, and watch captains co-invest; price-fixing suits multiply; newcomers shut out.  
- **Temple fissures:** Splendid Word (open-door syncretism) grows in colonial fronts; Beats 1–3 split over permissive rites (no formal schism yet).  
- **Censorate creep (soft):** Warrant thresholds stay high but definitions widen; “seditionary rumor” prosecutions target whistleblowers in finance.  
- **Rural neglect:** Inland courts under-served; reed-camp abuses persist behind better paperwork; grain shocks from interior droughts ripple to ports.  
- **Security complacency:** Escorts rely on paid gray fleets; true naval training declines; pirates learn the tables too.  
- **Climate & sea:** Silting at major bars accelerates (successful seawalls change sediment); dredge cycles lengthen; Old Song seasonal variance ticks up.

## Hooks
- Koi-Hi insurance steps scandal; a Beacon leg defaults mid-storm; a Splendid Word open-air rite draws both Beats and Bench; a chart school falsifies a reef sound for bribes.
