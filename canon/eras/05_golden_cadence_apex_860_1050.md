## Thesis
Prosperity via predictable calendars, capital projects, and cartelized logistics; the same structures ossify and amplify shocks (weather, debt, politics).

## Overview
- Chart/printing refinements; copperplate; guild standards.
- Big harbor/canal maintenance cycles; debt rollovers.
- Pirate suppression vs. collusion controversies.

## Key transitions → post-1050 scaffolding
- Maintenance burdens and legitimacy fatigue set up retrenchment.
