## Era Thesis
The **Mangrove Garrot** is what pilots call the century when river-mangrove chokes strangled the coast: beacons failed, fees floated, and convoys learned to move with gunpowder and paper instead of imperial protection. Pirate benches flared and died; **Contract Port** benches and **subscription escorts** survived. By the 1290s, a reliable **Widiwidi lane** and the bonded node at **Koi-Hi** turned rumor into schedules.

## Map of Forces (why 1200–1290 behaves like this)
- **Signals fail:** maintenance debt rolls past service life; beacon rows go dark; **Blue Papers** jack up rates.
- **Powder enters practice:** swivels and small bombards migrate from walls to escort cutwaters.
- **Paper governs:** **Steps** post **Rate-Holds**; fee-farms rent fund Debt Office stairs; benches sell access hours.
- **Nodes matter:** couriers + assay + bonded stock decide which ports are real; others starve.

## Era Beats (anchor events)
- **1205–1215 — Early “Broken Lantern” seasons.** Independents inshore; first pirate benches appear in mangroves and reef-cuts; republics burn out in a harvest.
- **1220s — Contract Port jurisprudence spreads.** Fee-farms and mixed writs monetize procedure; escort syndicates form under stretched letters of marque.
- **1240s — Reef-galleon prototypes & swivel discipline.** Escorts standardize “storm rules.”
- **1260s — Killian temple split hardens.** North hosts assay and Steps (convoys welcome); South toys with sanctuary and tithe-in-kind (pirate alliances fail when granaries empty).
- **1285 — Black Bell Year.** Three beacon rows fail; Steps post punitive **Blue Papers**.
- **1287 — Camra Dona elected High Master.** Tau-Hi link by marriage; pilot-chorus charted.
- **1289–1291 — The safe window found.** Two festival windows produce all-ships returns; **Rate-Hold** issued for escorted Widiwidi convoys.
- **1294 — Koi-Hi chartered as bonded node.** Assay + granary + rope sheds halve voyage risk.

## Lanes & Seasons (how the “safe route” works)
- **Windows:** two festival windows with stable westing and reliable return.
- **Lee chain:** outbound legs ride lee shores behind an eastern arc; **volcanic plume** used as landfall proof.
- **Chorus practice:** private **pilot-leaf cache** (reef dyes, star lines, roof-geese migration cues) held off the public Steps until third safe return.
- **Convoy regimen:** rate-locked escorts, powder rations, **Access Days** pre-booked at nodes; Koi-Hi splits the run into two hops.

## Regions (one paragraph each)
- **Ord:** bureaucracy deepens; Works/Steps winches keep core wards fed; escorts hired by subscription.
- **Sar cities:** **Knees vs. Seven Fingers** quarrel over reef-cut gates; Tau-Hi thrives (delta + bondable stock) and colonizes eastern Sar (cutting + mushroom cultivation + wetlands).
- **Killian Temple Cities:** North (assay + Steps + charter) becomes convoy hub; South flirts with sanctuary, gains raiders, loses winters.
- **Free Cities:** ritualized town fights; northern tribes push river towns up western Ord tributaries—raider/trader/mercenary mix.

## Widiwidi Cargo (why anyone risks it)
- **Mineral/chemical:** native sulfur, alum, pozzolan ash, iron sand (titanomagnetite).
- **Botanical/animal:** kairi pepper, longbark, ghost ginger oil, tree-glass resins, shell-purple pockets, sea-silk/reef lacquer; sailback oil if range overlaps.
- **Soft commodities:** breadfruit and swamp-taro slips; bast for cordage.

## Governance & Economy (what changes)
- **From posts to charters:** benches price law; **bench-dockets** codify fees/fines; **fee-farms** smooth central cashflow.
- **Procurement as doctrine:** escorts, oil, rope, bombards acquired via posted **Works Lists**, serviced by Debt Office stair, rate-held by Insurers.
- **Scrip beats coin (at the nodes):** **grain notes**, convoy tickets, claims paper circulate; inland discounts persist.

## Tactics & Tech (short)
- **Ambush doctrine:** mangrove chokes + dusk tides; dye-marked channels; swivels with case/chain; line-guns; grapnels.
- **Escort doctrine:** no-chase rule beyond convoy radius; storm formation; trumpet signals; smoke and reef dyes to mark cuts.

## Outcomes by 1290
- **Fewer, fatter cities** near nodes; inland de-urbanization toward river granaries.
- **Regularized Widiwidi convoys;** pirate benches become seasonal nuisances rather than existential threats.
- **Temple North richer, South quieter;** Sar cities stabilize under charter wars, not sack.
