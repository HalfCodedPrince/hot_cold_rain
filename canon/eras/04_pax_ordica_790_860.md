## Thesis
Stability through procedure: presumption rules, harbor safety regimes, and festival calendars normalize empire-wide rhythms.

## Overview
- Harbor Watches; fog bells; insurance and premiums.
- Diet/Seal habits and the “Three Seals” doctrine in practice.
- Public debt and works cadence.

## Key transitions → Era-05
- Capacity strains foreshadow cost overruns and later factionalism.

## Cross-refs
- `canon/systems/culture/sar_ord_game_and_festivals.md`
- `canon/systems/security/modern_piracy_navies.md`
- `canon/systems/economy/currency_finance.md`

## TODO
- Link 792 Harbor Watches; 800 Seven Fingers trial; 827 succession.
