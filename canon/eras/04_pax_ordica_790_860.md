## Overview
By 790 AO, Ord–Sar holds little beyond the Salt River and Ord Bay. Prices spike, crews desert, and councils knife one another. **Nerise Zambrani** (cash, cousins, choirs) and **Marak Kllrian** (the last real fleet) strike a bargain in public ritual: vow, pact, and the **Oar-Bench Oath**. Rivals are maneuvered into fighting each other; the Seven Fingers fleet is broken in rain and shoal; and the republic’s forms—**election, seals, drums**—are used as theater for compliance.

## Phases
- **790–796 AO: The Pull-Out.** Council election under emergency; Harbor Watches (Ord Bay) chartered; Beacon Chain started; Insurance Steps bill drafted; censorate fenced by Beat Six warrants.
- **797–804 AO: The Settling.** Emerald Shoals victory; Seven Fingers trial; Calendar & Measures Circular; convoy assurance tables posted.
- **805–827 AO: The Calm.** Tribute regularizes; pretenders wither; Marak lost at sea (**821**); **Empty Seat** observed; in **827**, Long Beat rule seats Nerise’s ward (nephew). Nerise dies **830**.

## Systems Impact
- **Governance & Law:** Forms preserved (election, countersign, warrants) but performance sharpened. Keeper’s registry becomes mundane, not miraculous.
- **Finance & Trade:** Insurance standards + watch certificates make “legal” traffic cheaper; privateers fold into licensed escorts.
- **Religion & Rite:** Vow under Oboe and Oar-Bench ritual become the state’s secular liturgy; choirs arbitrate calendars more than doctrine.
