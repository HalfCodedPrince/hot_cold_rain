## Thesis
Maritime city-states regularize tolls, convoys, and courts; shared threats (piracy, famine) catalyze inter-city compacts and the first island/river campaigns.

## Overview
- Harbor works; convoy signals; famine relief logistics.
- Beat Houses as public health and adjudication.
- Early wars (Wurran; frontier raids) and tributary bargains.

## Key transitions → Era-02
- Standard convoy code and harbor law foundations.
- Political will for Ord–Sar compacts.
