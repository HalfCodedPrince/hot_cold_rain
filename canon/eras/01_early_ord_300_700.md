# ERA-300 — Early Ord Consolidation (300–700 AO)
ID: ERA:300

## Thesis
Ord grows from coastal oligarchy to hemisphere frame-builder. Council of Captains dominates policy; the High Master rises during wars but relents in peace. Sar cities re-emerge as cultural engines; Kllrian temple-ports become the granary. By ~700 AO, Ord–Sar is a political fact.

## Themes
- Oligarchic expansion; standardizing fleets; tribute over annexation.
- Sar tutors/law reshape Ord elite culture.
- Repeated public-works misfires (sewer v1–v2) before Sar-engineered v3 works.

## Anchors
- REG:ORD-BAY (Ord Bay & mouths) — arsenal/harbors.
- REG:KLR-ARC (Kllrian arc) — paddy grain & oars.
- REG:SAR-NORTH (Tau-Hi, Seven Fingers, Knees) — semi-independent.

## Institutions
- Council of Captains; High Master (emergency); Treasury of Quays; Temple Harmonies.
- Tributary contracts with Sar/Kllr cities: garrison + rites + grain.

## Tech
- Oar galleys with sprits; lateen auxiliaries appear late in this era.
- Bronze elite weaponry; iron spreads in tools & spearheads (bog iron in uplands).

## Military
- Boarding excellence; weak inland logistics; reliance on mercs & allies.

## Continuity Locks
1) Sewer v1–v2 fail, v3 succeeds with Sar engineering.
2) Hull/Signal standardization pilots late era.
3) Sar honorifics (-ir/-is) enter legal titles.
