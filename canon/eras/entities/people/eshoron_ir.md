## Summary
Eshoron Ir bridges temple and state: a patient organizer who turned a printed recension into a functioning civic rhythm. His tenure emphasized legal codification, choir training, and calendar harmonization across ports.

## Roles
- **Convenor, Editorial Circle** — chaired deliberations; resolved doctrinal disputes into singable, enforceable forms.  
- **Civic Integrator** — aligned festivals, tariffs, and work-rests with the calendar via courts and magistracies.

## Succession & Early Policies
Upon Zambran’s abdication/death in **726 AO**, Eshoron is confirmed High Master. Early acts: confirm **compository** licensing, formalize the **Synod of Beats**, and publish a civic rites schedule for ports.
