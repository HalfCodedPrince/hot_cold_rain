## Profile
Seli preached geometry and baths: clean lines, clean hands, and **clean copies** open to marginal commentary. She loved choirs but not monopolies, and argued that **mercy is cheaper** than blood.

## Timeline
- **1458** — Elected **Rector** of the **Tau-Hi Lyceum**.  
- **1463–1472** — Publishes *Clean Water Dialogues*; **bath-house sermons** travel as plays.  
- **1475** — Exiled after a Plate Warrant raid; flees to **Morum**; opens a soup-dock and tiny press.  
- **1476–1490** — Organizes **Refugee Enclave Charters** in Sar ports and Free Cities.  
- **1499** — Dies in Morum; last sermon urges dropping **Deafening**.

## Doctrines
- **Open Commentary:** Beat II may guard *modes*, not *monopoly*.  
- **Lustral Justice:** restitutional rites (baths, bonds, rebuilding).  
- **Water-set Calendars:** festivals follow **basins**, not bench politics.

## Style & Methods
Processions from bath-steps to assay stalls; choruses alternating with **washings**; pamphlets in dialogue form.
