## Overview (student paragraph)
After the convulsions of foundation and conquest, Ord–Sar settles into a practiced rhythm.
Ports are dredged, canals aligned, tariffs harmonized, and the Good Old Rhythm becomes
the civic calendar. The High Master’s office grows ceremonial while provincial captains
govern under common law. Sar academies revive philosophy; Ord shipyards perfect hull families.
Peace is institutional habit—fragile, but effective.
