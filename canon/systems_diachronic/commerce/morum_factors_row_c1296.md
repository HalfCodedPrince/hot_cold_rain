## Thesis
Licensed brokers on the Row convert captured lots into **Cleansed Goods Warrants (CGW)** for a posted commission and route them through assay and custody.

## Mechanics
- **Commission:** customary **4–7%** on cleared lots.  
- **CGW issuance:** warrants prove **Assay + Duty + Docket** on captured goods.  
- **Queue & draw:** lots are assigned to assay/warehouse **by draw**; **split-assay** protects grades.  
- **Licensing:** factor licenses are **bonded** and **posted each festival**.  
- **Thumb-mark warrants:** illiterate captains may sign by **thumb-mark**.  
- **Small lots:** the **Three-Scratch Docket** applies to simplified cases.

## Paper & forms
- **CGW** — cleansing warrant for resale/export.  
- **Thumb-mark warrant** — captain’s mark accepted in place of a signature.  
- **Three-Scratch Docket** — minimal docket for small lots.

## Interfaces
- **Assay Ring (courier circuit):** draws and split-assay align with licensed testers and slips.  
- **Mangrove Gardens:** adjacent houses funnel crews into paperwork and exchange.  
- **Fog-Gate Marts:** factors operate at seasonal marts under festival warrants.
