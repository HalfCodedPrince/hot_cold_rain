## Scope & Thesis
Fire enters the hand by stages: **fire-lance → handgonne → match-serpentine → true matchlock**. Climate and convoys shape adoption: powder is strong; **humidity and logistics** punish the careless.

## Timeline (AO)
- **c.1290–1310** — **Fire-lance** (bamboo/bronze tube on pole; hot mix + darts). Boarding terror; short range.
- **c.1300–1340** — **Socket handgonne** (bronze or wrought-iron staves & hoops; touch-hole): shot from a rest; one man aims while another touches fire.
- **c.1340–1380** — **Stocked handgonne** (tiller stock; hook for walls/rails). First **pivoted serpentine** clamps hold a slow match over the pan.
- **c.1380–1450** — **Matchlock** spreads: pinned/pivot **serpentine** triggered by lever; pan covers and priming flasks become standard.
- **c.1450–1500** — **“Snap” match** variants appear in rich yards; still rare.

## Builds & Shops
- **Barrels:** early **bronze cast**, then **wrought-iron staves** hoop-welded (your iron-sand blooms → ◇I/◇II bars).  
- **Stocks & rests:** ash or mangrove-root tillers; hooks for recoil into bulwark.  
- **Locks:** start as a **loose clamp** for a matchcord; evolve into **pinned serpentine** with a simple trigger.  
- **Tools:** boring rods, reamers, taps for vents; pan covers and rain caps common in deltas.

## Powder, Priming & “Tree-glass”
- **Corned** in edge-runner houses; grains **light-shellacked (tree-glass)** to bind fines and resist damp.  
- **Priming** finer than main charge; kept in horn/flask with stopper.  
- **Matchcord**: hemp or bast, **saltpeter-boiled**, slow, steady burn; carried in clay pots to stay lit in squalls.

## Rates & Ranges (field real)
- **Handgonne (no lock):** ~1 shot/min with drill; useful under **50 m**; terror & shock, not precision.
- **Match-serpentine:** **1–2/min** in dry weather; misfires climb in swamp air unless priming is capped and cord is hot.
- **Swivel “rail gonnes”:** small bores on yoke mounts; excel at **anti-personnel** during boardings.

## Tactics
- **Pike/board with fire:** shields/pavises forward; gunners fire in pairs; **hooks** anchor to rail or parapet.  
- **Jungle & mangrove:** fire-lance volleys to panic; handgonnes to punch shields; disease and mud finish fights.  
- **Convoys:** swivels at quarter and fore; **prize law** rewards captures of enemy benches more than sinkings.

## Climate Discipline
- Waxed caps over pans; keep **match tubs** under awnings; rotate powder from **sealed jars**; re-shellac grains in the wet season.  
- Corrosion watch: oil and tree-glass on touch-holes; boil cord with saltpeter, dry in **charcoal-lime lofts**.

## Failure Modes
- **Hangfires & blooms** from damp priming; **vent erosion** on wrought barrels; **stock splits** in rain.  
- Fixes: better vent cones; pan covers; **tree-glass** varnish; quarter-sawn stocks.

## Paper & Policing
- **Marque dockets** require yard marks on barrels; Steps won’t insure anonymous handgonnes.  
- Garden licenses forbid **off-book** powder sales; seizure = minting-fraud band.
