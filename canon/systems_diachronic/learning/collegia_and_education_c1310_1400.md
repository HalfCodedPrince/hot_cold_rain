## Institutions
- **Temple/Ward schools** (reading, weights/measures, catechism).  
- **Guild schools** (craft math/drawing).  
- **Collegia** (five faculties: Pilotry, Works, Assay, Song & Law, Arts & Stage).

## Law & Privilege
**Scholars’ Peace:** students/staff under Song & Law courts; collegia police their own (rowdy rep).

## Curricula
- **Pilotry:** star/reef leaves, convoy rules.  
- **Works:** pozzolan, iron-sand, mills.  
- **Assay & Account:** metrology, charge-and-discharge, fee-farms.  
- **Song & Law:** rhetoric, ritual, bench.  
- **Arts & Stage:** drama, pamphlet press, lanterncraft.

## Ladders & Bursaries
- **Chorus bursary** (temple voice), **Steps stipend** (insurer math), **Works billet** (orphans, clerks).

## Parent’s Guide
- **Captain:** Pilot Hall + Assay minor → **Pilot Leaf**, convoy credential.  
- **Craftsman:** guild → Lyceum → Works bursary → **Shop Master Leaf**.  
- **Paddy peasant:** ward bursary exam → copyist → Assay/Song on stipend.

## Failure Modes
Nepotism (Kin-Maze), doctrinal feuds (Deafening), student riots; managed by Cleanliness Tables & festival courts.
