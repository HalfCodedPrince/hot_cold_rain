## Thesis
Kllrian polities keep ancestor-terrace and water-spirit rites privately while **performing the minimum Rhythm in public**. Vows bind **in stone**; water is witness.

## Hallmarks
- **Places**: stepped reservoirs; terrace altars; sluice shrines; funerary **water-tables**.  
- **Rites**: **channel-turning** festivals; stone-carved **vow lines**; ancestor **feeding** (breadfruit, rum).  
- **Public face**: ward chants on cue, charity paid, calendars met; Beat VI kept at arm’s length.  
- **Texts**: **Old Words** inscribed; scrolls rare; songs learned at the weir.

## Law & Peace
- **Concordat of Three Gates** (custom): city meets Rhythm at festival gates—**charity**, **calendar**, **oaths**—keeps private rites immune if taxes and schedules hold.

## Frictions & Fits
- **With Ord/Sar**: fine with ports; balks at doctrinal inquests; shrugs at pamphlets.  
- **With Knees**: easy neighbors; share stone-dance in drought years.  
- **With Crum cities**: trades vow-stones for market oaths.
