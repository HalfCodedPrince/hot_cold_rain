# Centralization Levers — From Benches to Leviathan (1400–1550 AO)

## Thesis
The Principality centralizes **without** a standing tax state by chaining monopolies and registries: **Access Days**, **postal**, **identity**, **marque**, **plates**, and **Co-Type charters**. Each lever is “administrative,” but together they make a Kafka lattice: overlapping seals, contradictory dockets, and fees for breathing.

## The levers (stacked)
1) **National Access Board (NAB)** — upgrades the Koi-Hi board to empire-wide custody over calendars; **priority = obedience**.  
2) **Rate-Hold Registry** — every covered hull & convoy under one book; **premium uplifts** applied by the center.  
3) **Postal Monopoly (Oboe Packet)** — all packets sealed; private posts illegal; **reader rolls** ride inside.  
4) **Plate Registry (House of the Second Beat)** — every master plate numbered; presses file runs; **off-plate** prints = seizure + fines.  
5) **Identity Rolls (“Beat Rolls”)** — ward **roll calls** bless identity; proof = **split token** (bone tally + wax mark); needed for tickets, courts, and scrip.  
6) **Convoy & Co-Type Acts** — turns escort compacts and colonial houses into **Company-Types** with police powers (fog-gate → colony ladder).  
7) **Marque & Muster Harmonization** — letters of marque tracked; **press** legalized in storm years; deserters denied tickets.  
8) **Fee-Farm Foreclosure** — arrears → **central seizure**; Works buys mills and yards; leases them back with clauses.  
9) **Cleanliness Tables → Black Books** — printer/port/press ratings harden into **ban ledgers** shared across the realm.  
10) **Green-Scrip** — emergency labor scrip for storms; redeemable only in licensed depots (behavior control via food).

## How it feels (the Kafka bit)
- **Double seals**: two offices demand different stamps for the same act; queues form; fines accrue while you stand.  
- **Contradictory dockets**: House of the Sixth Beat court says pay; NAB clerk says “not until Access is posted.”  
- **Endless copies**: “Copy of copy” fees; the original lost “in packet.”  
- **Identity loops**: to get onto a roll you need a ticket; to buy a ticket you need a roll token.  
- **Harmless crimes**: “lantern mis-hang,” “wrong meter filing,” “unauthorized queue change.”

## Records & proofs (by lever)
- **Access**: NAB circulars and posted calendars.  
- **Rate-Hold**: flags/lanterns and registry entries.  
- **Postal**: packet seals and receipt leaves.  
- **Plates**: plate numbers on copy-leaves; printer run filings.  
- **Identity**: split-tokens matched to ward rolls.  
- **Convoy/Co-Type**: company charters and patrol writs.  
- **Marque/Muster**: docketed commissions and muster rolls.  
- **Fee-Farms**: foreclosure dockets and leasebacks.  
- **Cleanliness/Black Books**: shared tables and bans.  
- **Green-Scrip**: depot chits and redemption tallies.

## Why elites allow it
- **Insurers** get a quieter sea;  
- **Works** gets steady budgets;  
- **Electors** get patronage (local clerks, rollmasters);  
- **Temples** get plate control;  
- **Companies** get police far from home.

## Breaking points (for later eras)
- The lattice works in peace; **fails in famine/war**; then comes the Last War—and PRK’s revolt.
