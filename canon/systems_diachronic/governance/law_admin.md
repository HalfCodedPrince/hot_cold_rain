# Law & Administration — From Captains to Diet

## Thesis
Maritime needs (convoys, quarantine, tolls) grew a **harbor-first legal order**: city councils, temple courts, and watch offices. In the Greater Principality the **Diet** and **Emperor-arbiter** formalized it; stalemate in the late Principality re-localized day-to-day power in councils and benches.

## Structures (who runs what)
- **Council of Captains** (Ord): merchant-naval oligarchy; elects **High Master** in emergencies. Provincial **Harbor Prefects** (tax/dredge/quarantine) and **Canal Wardens** (locks/fees).
- **Temple houses & Synod**: calendar authority; circuit discipline; co-signs civic forms touching rites and courts.
- **Keeper’s Registry**: seals, ledgers, interregnum custody; joint-lock procedures per absence law.
- **Harbor Watches**: closure beacons, headland bells, convoy reporting and patrol.
- **Procurement fee-farms**: tenders for dredge, beacons, escorts, and bonded storage.
- **Diet & Principality** (Greater Principality): estates/cities; Emperor as arbiter; chronic deadlock late GP.

## Domains (what the law covers)
- **Maritime:** registry; salvage & wreck; pilotage; bottomry/respondentia; letters of **marque** in limited seasons.
- **Markets:** weights/measures; guild charters; **port warrants**; assay slips; bonded stores.
- **Public order:** storm curfews; levee trespass; canal sabotage (capital in wartime).

## Courts & Policing (how it’s enforced)
- **Circuit Judges** (temple boats); **Harbor Watch**; **Riverine Guard**; **Assurance/Prize benches** for convoy loss and seizure review. Evidence: **seal rolls**, **shell-impress**, sworn **oboe call**.

## Practices & Forms
- **Warrants & notes:** metrology standards referenced on stamped forms; port warrants tie to convoy calendars and assay circuits.
- **Elections & interregna:** see **Empty Seat** for absence law; **Keeper** holds interim seals; **Edict of the Long Beat** governs notices.
- **Custody chains:** **courier circuit/assay ring** links marts and warehouses; split tallies back redemptions.

## Timeline (c.700–1400 AO)
- **700–1200 (Cadence to decline):** musters/retainers regularized; **letters of marque** define convoy reprisals; fee-farms fund dredge, beacons, warehousing; Synod and Censorate cohere recension and warrant plates.
- **1200–1290 (Consolidation):** piracy compacts harden; **courier/assay circuits** standardize custody; treaty-port habits spread on stamped forms and rate cards.
- **1290–1400 (Principality frame):** Diet practice sets access days and stair procedure; the **1304 charter** fixes proclamation, common rates, convoy duties, and prize review; benches feed into Diet benches; Keeper custody during vacancies is narrowed and audited.

## Risks / Failure Modes
- **Stalemate:** Diet vetoes; princes govern by delay.
- **Capture:** harbor offices rent-seek; watch bribery in lean years.
- **Distance law:** inland cases lag; temple boats stretch circuits.
