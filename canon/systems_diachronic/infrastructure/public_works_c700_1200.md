# Public Works — Beacons, Seawalls & Cisterns

## Thesis
Ports run on **light, edges, water**. Beacons set time and approach. Seawalls set shape and depth. Cisterns keep labor alive. Works bind climate to ledger and post the windows.

## Overview
- **Beacons & bells.** Range beacons, horn houses, and tide boards align with seasonal lanes; signal huts on capes post **Receive/Dispatch** and moon tables.  
- **Seawalls & reef-quays.** Rubble cores with **pozzolan** caps fix channel geometry; dredging cycles follow the Old Song and ward silt books.  
- **Quays & lifts.** Two-crew lifts standardized; capstan rails and timber cranes carry blocks and barrels.  
- **Cisterns & ladders.** Covered slow-sand cisterns feed blue-tag taps; canal ladders lift water inland; limewash keeps algae down.

## Institutions / Actors
- **Office of Imperial Works** charters and audits; **Dredge & Bar Works** builds and keeps the bars; **Harbor Watches** keep bells and Access Days.  
- **Temple clinics** and storm depots share hoist rails and yard nodes for surge care.

## Practices & Standards
- **Navigation packages** (printed): tide tables, light lists, horn charts; wet-air shifts ring the bells.  
- **Slotting.** Reef-quay berth sizes posted; Access Days gate convoy entries; mill-hours (for stone and pozzolan) booked via ward books.  
- **Materials.** Pozzolan A for splash/underwater joints; B for stem fills; hot-lime putty only; river sand washed.

## Economics / Logistics
- **Procurement.** Works Lists specify caps and windows; **Debt Office** stairs fund phases; fee-farms service rents.  
- **Couriers.** Schedules, dockets, and dredge notes ride sealed bags; warehouses redeem tickets for barrels and rope.  
- **Risk.** If the Old Song varies, dredge debt rises and **Steps** adjust premiums.

## Risks / Failure Modes
- **Silt misplacement** after “successful” walls; tailraces choke.  
- **Wormed gates** and fog-bell neglect in green-rain seasons.  
- **Cistern contamination** without sand change or cover; dry-years salt creep.

## Controls & Posting
- **Boards.** Access Days, range outages, dredge closures, and cistern change-days chalked and printed to doors and beacon legs.  
- **Inspections.** Gate leaves, fish-passes, bell ropes, and cistern sands logged; fines posted at festival.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Works List (WL-L):** oil, wick, rope, stone, timber, pozzolan, caps.  
- **Beacon Plan (BP-R):** light list, horn code, range bearings.  
- **Dredge Pass (DP-W):** cut, spoil ground, hours, keeper mark.  
- **Cistern Book (CB-S):** sand change, draw, tests, ward seals.  
- **Access Notice (AN-H):** entry windows by moon/tide; bell marks.  
- **Repair Ticket (RT-G):** gate leaves, wheel rims, bell hoods; stair code.

## Complexity Dial
- **Core wards:** full beacon chains; tidal horns; printed boards; dredge on schedule; dual cisterns with slow-sand beds.  
- **Near-coast towns:** range pairs, single horn, hand-copied boards; dredge slips as-needed.  
- **Interior:** daymarks, no horns; cisterns lime-only; dredge is seasonal hand-scoop.
