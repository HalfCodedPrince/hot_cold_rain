## Preamble
To keep the **Access & Peace** of the Bright Sea and to service the Common Stair, the Electors and Cities agree this Charter.

## I. Of the Emperor
1. Elected for life by the **College of Electors (7)**.
2. May convene the Diet; propose **War Stairs**; appoint the **Keeper of the Oboe Seal**.
3. May not levy taxes nor void posted **bench-dockets**.
4. Removal by petition of **five Electors** for breach of Access & Peace.

## II. Of the Diet
1. Two Colleges: **Electors (7 votes)** and **Cities (12 rotating)**.
2. Cities may **delay** an Elector act one festival; after the delay, Elector majority suffices.
3. Open Floor at each festival for benches, Steps, Works, compacts (one hour).

## III. Of Money & Stairs
1. **Common Stair** funds beacons/dredge; serviced by **fee-farms** and insurer tithes.
2. **War Stair** may run for **two festivals**; renewal requires fresh vote.
3. Refusal bears no fine, but forfeits: **Rate-Hold eligibility**, **Access Days priority**, and the right to **pledge farms** at central Houses until arrears cleared.

## IV. Of Access Days & Nodes
1. **Access Days Board (Koi-Hi)** arbitrates convoy calendars; Electors hold parity seats.
2. Nodes (Koi-Hi, Vitrana, Morum) keep **assay rings** and **bonded stock**; no sanctuary for pirates.

## V. Of Prize & Amnesty
1. **Prize Dockets** at the Steps decide captures; **Morum Exchange** may cleanse goods under Assay + Duty + Docket.
2. **Amnesty Leaves** may billet surrendered pirates to Works yards and colonies.

## VI. Of Peace
1. Disputes between Electors lie to the **High Bench of Ord**.
2. No city may harbor a **pirate bench**; Blue Papers post uplifted premiums on violators.

*Sealed at Ord in the Year 1304 AO.*
