## Cadence baseline
- Drum & ward muster; levy credits; Captain-Rep postings; Watch limited to quays.

## Decline drift
- **Paper-first** musters; exemption markets; Watch houses dual-hat as militias; **letters of marque** blur convoy/raid lines.

## Practical effect
- Fast to **order**, slow to **arrive**; obedience becomes interpretation.
