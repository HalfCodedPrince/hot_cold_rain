# Insurance Steps (c.300–700 AO)

## Primer
After the collapse of Cuzhar Krum, Bright Sea ports revived the tradition of posting rates, premiums, and claims on raised stone steps—visible from across the harbor and safe from high tides. These “Steps” echoed Krum’s contract stairs, blending ritual with practical need. 

Convoy rates and claim awards were set by Captain Councils, then publicly posted by official Whips. Claims and payments were filed and witnessed in public, with Whips keeping order and enforcing fair process. Posting on the Steps anchored trust in trade, adapting ancient practices to new city life.

## Thesis
The Insurance Steps served as both a physical and civic platform: all rates and awards were visible and verifiable, and the steps themselves became a landmark for merchant gatherings and official announcements. The office of the Whip emerged here, fusing lawkeeping, public notice, and queue discipline.

## Changes since Cuzhar Krum / Pre-Ord
- Stone steps (or raised platforms) replace temple stairs for civic postings.
- Captain Councils (not priests or syndics) set rates and arbitrate claims.
- The first Whips appointed to maintain order and post new rates.
- Separation from the Bench is clarified: court fees and fines remain on the Bench, insurer rates/claims are handled on the Steps.

## Standards/Forms used
- Chalk or clay rate boards posted atop the Steps.
- Oral claims, with first written receipts by 7th century AO.
- Daily postings erased at dusk, new rates at dawn.
- Oath-stone kept near the Steps for swearing goods/measure/price/time before a claim proceeds.

## Interfaces
- Captain Council sets/approves rates.
- Whips post rates, announce changes, manage queues, and enforce order.
- Merchants, brokers, and captains gather to read postings and file claims.

## Failure Modes
- Tampering or forgery if Steps are left unguarded.
- Disputes over oral vs. written records.
- Flood or crowd disruptions if Steps are too low or poorly built.
