**Scope:** legal statuses and labor regimes from c. 300–1000 AO, with notes to colonial practice later.

## Status Classes (legal shorthand)
- **Citizen** — free person with civic obligations/rights (varies by city).  
- **Freeman/Freed** — former slave, legally free; collateral restrictions persist (guild entry, office).  
- **Debt-Bond** — bonded until debt/service term; sale limited, children free at majority.  
- **Indentured** — fixed-term contract (typically 6–12 years) for passage, training, or penal commutation.  
- **Chattel Slave** — movable property in law; rights by city (marriage, testimony) vary.  
- **Temple-Servant** — in Klr cities, “slaves of the god”: corvée-like; not alienable outside temple law.  
- **Penal Laborer** — condemned to labor terms (quarry, reed-camp, dredge); duration fixed but often fatal.

## Sources of Coerced Labor
- **War Captives** (city wars, piracy cases).  
- **Debt & Default** (bonded labor, household slavery).  
- **Penal Sentences** (transport to camps/colonies).  
- **Contract Migration** (indentures to Widiwidi/Sar estates).

## Manumission & Mobility
Manumission exists across cities (fees, service, owner’s will). Freed people often cluster in **guild-adjacent roles** (portering, cooking, small craft), with limited office-holding. Children of freed typically free at birth.

## Administrative Tone
Records the **brutality in ledgers**: intake lists, mortality rates, manumission fees, absconders’ notices. The state reckons costs; the books show the harm.
