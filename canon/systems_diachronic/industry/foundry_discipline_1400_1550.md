# Foundry Discipline & Heat Practice (c.1400–1550 AO)

## Thesis
Output rises in the pamphlet century by **discipline**: measured heats, charcoal husbandry, proof tests, and civic posting. After 1503, **Mixed Courts + Green Edicts** turn inspection into ritual: fewer brands, more **fines-as-theatre** and posted grades.

## Shop Types (rules of thumb)
- **Bloomery & finery.** Bulk wrought iron; proof by bend/peen/file; quench only for tools.  
- **Hearth / carburizing pits.** Case-hardening for edges/springs; sealed pack cementation.  
- **Crucible rooms (rare).** Small high-grade heats in rich ports; guarded recipes; high fuel cost.

## Inputs & Fuel
Bog iron and river sands near polders; limestone/sea-shell flux; **charcoal by quota** (ward caps). Ash kept for lye in pickling. River sheds seek steady water and barge access.

## Heat Discipline (guild rubric)
- **Charge & burden.** Tables posted at the bench; impurity notes chalked on wall.  
- **Wind & draw.** Bellows cadence logged (apprentice duty); stack color recorded hourly.  
- **Color & spark.** Pull/quench by heat color and spark length; supervisors sign the hourbook.  
- **Proof tests.** File, bend, ring; proof stamps struck in sight of the bench; rejects re-melted or marked **yard only**.

## Grades & Marks
- **A (shop/rig).** Full proof; maker + ward mark; eligible for city contracts.  
- **B (common).** Meets bend/file; no spring duty; marked with half-stroke.  
- **Y (yard only).** For scaffolds, crates, quay repairs; barred from lifts or arms.  
Grade lists are posted on guild doors and beacon legs after inspections.

## Safety, Law & Posting
- **Edicts & ward codes.** Rails, drains, hooded stacks required; **Access Day** drills for quench/fire/spill.  
- **Mixed Courts.** Ear burns, roof fires, and **bad iron** suits; Free Cities favor **fines** over brands; repeat neglect closes the shed.  
- **Beacon-leg postings.** Closures and grade letters are nailed to beacon legs and guild doors; re-openings need an inspector’s seal.

## Labor & Organization
Apprentice ladders under sworn masters. Quiet lanes through sheds; shrine rails near hammers. Night heats restricted in dense wards unless bells warn neighbors. Sanctuary charters align clinic windows with shift changes.

## Finance & Supply
Charcoal quotas tighten in dry years; **Debt Office** floats small bonds against ward caps; **Works** pre-buys rig metal when harbor jobs queue. Powder and shot pulls on fuel compete with **saltpeter supply** ramps after 1500.

## Products (1500s typical)
Bar and plate; hoops and nails; tool blanks (adzes, chisels, springs); fittings for rigs, locks, cranes; simple shot and hoops for early guns. Heavy ordnance remains bespoke and slow.

## Environmental Knobs
Forest caps and seasoning cycles; ash-yard runoff tiled to gutters; water-right disputes with dyers and paper-mills. Flood years shutter riverside sheds and push smelting inland.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Heat Hourbook (HH-R):** cadence, color, pulls, signatures.  
- **Proof Register (PR-S):** stamp dies, lots, grades, rejects.  
- **Inspection Writ (IW-M):** findings, fines, closures; witness list.  
- **Reopening Seal (RS-I):** inspector’s seal authorizing restart after remedy.

## Hooks (GM)
- A **roof fire** shutters a finery; a rival posts satyr-fines on the tower leg.  
- A **bad bar** breaks on a crane; Mixed Court day follows—was the proof stamp forged?  
- A **charcoal quota** bites mid-season; a debt clerk offers a quiet bond—strings attached.  
- A **night heat** runs during a green-rain; beadles pull the bell—panic or politics?
