# Pozzolan & Hydraulic Mortar (c.1200 AO)

## Scope & Thesis
Volcanic **pozzolan** blended with hot lime gives **hydraulic mortar** that cures in spray and underwater—fit for **seawalls, slipways, beacon foundations, cisterns**. This page standardizes grading, mixes, site practice, and the paperwork that lets **Works** buy and trust it.

## Sourcing & Grading
- **Sources:** volcanic ash (Widiwidi rim), pumice fines, kiln-ground scoria.  
- **Grades:**  
  - **Pozzolan A (fine):** passes tight sieve; for underwater/splash joints.  
  - **Pozzolan B (coarse):** bulk masonry and stem fills.  
- **Assay slip (POZ-ASL):** fineness index, soluble salts rating, mass/volume, stall mark.

## Lime & Aggregates
- **Lime:** shell/limestone burnt in clamp or draw kilns → **quicklime** → **hot-slaked** to putty.  
- **Aggregates:** washed **river sand** preferred; shell sand allowed for light mixes if washed free of salts.

## Mix Designs (by volume boxes)
- **Underwater joints:** `1 hot lime putty : 2 Pozzolan A : 3–4 fine sand` (stiff).  
- **Splash zone / quay caps:** `1 : 1 Pozzolan A/B : 4–5 sand`.  
- **Mass pours (bagwork):** `1 : 1.5 Pozzolan B : 5–6 mixed aggregate` (rammed in place).  
> **Rule:** if the trowel slumps, it’s too wet. Strength lives in **putty + pozzolan**, not water.

## Placement Methods
- **Bagwork:** canvas sacks prefilled; placed/tamped below water; cut flush after set.  
- **Cloth formers:** hemp sleeves stuffed and rammed for tidal joints.  
- **Timber cribs:** pozzolan fill poured into crib cells for fast quay raise.  
- **Scarf joints:** feathered beds on old work; scrub and pre-wet to avoid dry suction.

## Curing & Protection
Keep damp and shaded **14+ days**; protect from wash with fascines/mats. In frost, build windbreaks, warm mix water, and delay tidal sets.

## Quality & Failure Modes
- **Job tests:** brine-drop ball (A should hold shape), scratch-set at 24 h, pry test at 7 d.  
- **Salts:** sharp ash? wash and drain before batching.  
- **Failures:**  
  - **Dusting surface** → mix too wet / sand too rounded.  
  - **Map cracking** → over-rich pozzolan, no damp cure.  
  - **Expansion** → sulfate contamination; reject batch (assay “S-high”).

## Logistics & Paper
- **Barrels & seals:** dry-kept, bung-waxed; **courier bags** carry slips and tally lists.  
- **Warehouses:** redeem **Works tickets** for sealed barrels; post shrinkage loss.  
- **Works Lists (spec tokens):** “**Pozzolan-A** (sealed), **Pozzolan-B**, **hot lime putty**, **river sand (washed)**.”

## Interfaces
- **Works:** specifies grade and window in tenders; inspects scarf prep.  
- **Procurement:** fee-farm rents service the stair that funds lime burn and barrel stock.  
- **Assay / Metrology:** stall certifies fineness/salts; keeps standard sieves and brine for tests.  
- **Hydrology:** tide tables and flood notes govern window picks for bagwork and cribs.

## Complexity Dial (core → rim)
- **Core wards:** printed specs; A/B barrels under seal; dual assay stalls; regular underwater joints.  
- **Near-coast towns:** coarse B common; hand-copied slips; crib fills over joint work.  
- **Interior:** lime-only mortars dominate; pozzolan used sparingly for cisterns.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **POZ-ASL:** assay slip (grade, fineness, salts, fee).  
- **WL-L excerpt:** “Pozzolan-A 30 brl (sealed), Pozzolan-B 40, Hot-lime putty 20 tubs, River sand 60 loads.”  
- **Set Book (SET-M):** date, weather, tide, bay number, crew marks, 7-day/14-day checks.

## Quick Gloss
- **bagwork:** underwater placement using filled sacks as stay-in-place forms.  
- **hot lime:** freshly slaked, still-warm lime putty—more reactive with pozzolan.
