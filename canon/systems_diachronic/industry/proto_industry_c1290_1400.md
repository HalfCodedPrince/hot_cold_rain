# Proto-Industry — Shops, Mills & Manufactures (1290–1400 AO)

## Thesis
Manufacture scales by **benches, bonds, and seasons**, not steam. Long sheds plus river/tidal wheels, stampers, and tilt hammers power rope, sail, paper, powder, sugar, and iron—timed to monsoons and **Access Days** and paid off **Works Lists**.

## Organization
- **Putting-out** for cloth and small wares; **manufactories** (≈40–200 hands) for rope, sail, paper, powder, iron.  
- Inputs pulled from bonded warehouses; cashflow bridged by stair-serviced notes under **procurement**.  
- Slotting via **ward mill books**; convoy calendars set ship-fit deadlines.

## Power & Plant
- **River/tidal mills**, spit windmills, treadmills and **capstans** for hoists and emergency bellows.  
- **Stilted sheds** with louvered walls; charcoal-lime drying lofts; yard rails for block and mast moves.  
- Typical trains: wheel → pit gear → wallower → spur → helve/cams; wheel → crank → bellows.

## Sectors
- **Rope & sail:** ropewalks (tar, warm kilns), sail lofts (wax/resin finish, bolt cloth by panel).  
- **Paper & print:** water stampers and vats; compositories feed collegia/benches.  
- **Powder:** warm **nitraries**; edge-runners; **corning houses** (screened grains).  
- **Iron:** **tataras** → blooms; **tilt hammers** → bar grades (◇I/◇II/◇III) per **iron_sand**.  
- **Sugar/rum:** animal/river mills; proof and levy at the warehouse door.  
- **Yards:** reef-galleon hulls, block-shops, cooperage, graving slips; **pozzolan** for slipways and quay caps.

## Climate Discipline
- Dry season: spin, weave, paper; rope finish and sail proofing.  
- Wet/monsoon: stamp pozzolan, corn powder, burn lime, heavy hammer work when rivers run.  
- Mold control by limewash, tannins, resin; cloth hung on high rails; kiln heat on storm weeks.

## Scheduling & Controls
- **Access Days** post mill slots by moon and tide; flood/neap tables hung at shed doors.  
- **Cleanliness Tables** in powder and paper; bell rules for night hammer runs in dense wards.  
- **Assay/Courier** moves slips, samples, and tender bags; late bags reorder queues.

## Finance & Paper
- **Works Lists** specify grades, windows, and escrow; redemption against warehouse tallies.  
- Fee-farm rents service the stair during tender windows per **procurement**.  
- Convoy and **piracy** compacts govern escort hours for finished lots headed to the roadstead.

## Failure Modes
- **Green Years** spoilage; charcoal runouts; queue corruption.  
- Mitigations: **Green-Scrip** shifts, charcoal reserves, posted queue audits; Access-Day rebooking after storm loss.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Mill Book (MB-W):** ward slots by craft/hour/wheel.  
- **Works List (WL-L):** items, caps, windows, seals.  
- **Assay Slip (sector-specific):** fiber/powder/iron grades as applicable.  
- **Queue Audit (QA-Q):** posted lot order, clerk marks, rebook reasons.

## Interfaces
- **mills_power_wetworld_c1250_1450:** wheel types, trains, and slot logic.  
- **iron_sand:** bar grades and assay marks for metal orders.  
- **pozzolan:** quay and slip construction windows.  
- **courier_assay:** bags, stalls, and remote tendering.  
- **economy / procurement:** rents, stairs, and fee-farms that fund the shop floor.
