# Mills & Power in a Wet World (c.1250–1450 AO)

## Thesis
Water and wind supply most shaft power. Rivers give cadence; tides give storage; wind fills gaps. Wards book mill-hours like berths. Workshops scale once hammers and stampers run on wheels, not arms.

## Map
- **River mills:** undershot in flats; breast/overshot where fall is cut. Drive a **tilt hammer**, stampers, bellows, or stones.  
- **Tidal mills:** pond behind a creek gate; grind, stamp, or saw on the ebb; sluice again at next flood.  
- **Wind on spits:** seasonal towers on bars and headlands; grain and saw; pump bilges and ponds in storm seasons.  
- **Human/animal:** treadmills and **capstans** inside yards for hoists and emergency bellows where wheels fail.

## Power Trains (typical)
- **Wheel → pit gear → wallower → spur gear → hammer helve** (trip-hammer).  
- **Wheel → cams → stamp box** (ore, fiber, pulp).  
- **Wheel → crank → bellows rod** (forge blast, bloom reheat).  
- **Wheel → saw frame** (rip saws in tidal sheds).

## Uses by Ward
- **Metal:** tilt hammers and bellows for fineries; light helves for edge-welds.  
- **Stone & clay:** stampers for pozzolan and pigment; pug mills for clay.  
- **Wood:** saw frames for mast and plank; capstan winches in yards.  
- **Grain & oil:** stones for meal; edge-runners for seed pressing where fall is small.

## Seasonal & Tidal Logic
- **Monsoon rivers:** schedule heavy hammer work at high water; shift to wind and capstans in low flow.  
- **Tidal ponds:** two ebbs yield two work windows; storm surges overtop gates—post **Access Days** by moon.  
- **Drought years:** windmills get priority cloth; Works may declare **Common Stair** draws for repair cloth and gate timber.

## Controls & Scheduling
- **Ward mill books** allocate wheel-time in hour blocks; Access Days gate queue order during flood, neap, and storm.  
- **Posting:** mill slots, gate rules, and flood closures are chalked at the mill door and copied to ward boards.  
- **Fuel & noise:** charcoal and night-hour rationing in dense wards; bells before night hammer runs.

## Finance & Works Interface
- **Repairs:** sluices, gates, and wheel-rims appear on **Works Lists**; costs serviced from the Common Stair when mills serve public loads.  
- **Private wheels:** owners keep gear-books; inspection on Access Days for gate condition and fish-passes.  
- **Leases:** banks and tailraces may be leased in spans; lapses for silt neglect revert water-rights to the ward.

## Failure Modes
- **Silt choke:** tailraces back up; dredge slips issued; poundage refunded while under Works repair.  
- **Wormed gates & runners:** brackish creeks eat wood; require copper nails and tar; slots close on warning.  
- **Storm-torn ponds:** berm breach drains the pond; mills idle until clay core is rebuilt.  
- **Gear failure:** tooth shear from wet shocks; keep sacrificial wood teeth and spare gudgeons on site.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Mill Book (MB-W):** slot ledger (ward, craft, hours, wheel, task).  
- **Gate Order (GO-T):** tide-open/close times; clerk and keeper marks.  
- **Silt Ticket (ST-R):** dredge request with tailrace depth; refund note if closure exceeds a day.  
- **Repair List (RL-W):** wheel rims, gate leaves, cloth, pins; links to Works List entry.

## Complexity Dial
- **Core wards:** mixed river + tidal plant; gear standard sizes; posted slot auctions; Works maintains gates.  
- **Near-coast towns:** one river wheel, one creek pond; hand-copied books; wind fills slack.  
- **Interior:** capstans and treadmills dominate; small undershot wheels in wet years only.
