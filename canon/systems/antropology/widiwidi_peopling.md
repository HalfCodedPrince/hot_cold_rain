## Thesis
Widiwidi was settled by **stepping-stone voyaging**: canoes/rafts across 20–100 km island gaps along seasonal sets, long before advanced hulls.

## Outline
- **Corridors:** archipelago chains and the Old Song’s residual set provide windows for crossings.
- **Modes:** planned hops and **drift voyaging** both contribute; toolkits evolve from paddled rafts to sail-assisted outriggers.
- **Demography:** pulses and bottlenecks → distinctive languages; periodic back-migrations remix coastal Ord/Sar ports.
- **Memory:** “First Crossing” legends; shrine stones oriented to pilot stars and Hex’s halo nights.

## Matters later
Island ecology + storm decades produce elastic carrying capacity; famine years leave deep marks in chant cycles and temple relief accounts.
