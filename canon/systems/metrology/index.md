## Scope
Practical standards used by ports, courts, and convoy finance during the Cadence and after.

### Length
- **span** (hand), **pace**, **rope** (ward rope; varies by charter), **quay-step** (tide stairs indexing).
- Survey notes record **rope origin** (ward/year) to prevent “short ropes.”

### Volume & Grain
- **drum** (convoy standard cask), **sack**, **bin**. Grain notes specify **drum class** and **tare**.

### Mass
- **stone** (dock stone; posted per ward), **weight-mark** stamped by **Grain Chancery** inspectors.

### Coin & Notes
- **lira** (account), **tar** (small silver/bronze), paper **grain notes** (see Currency & Finance).
- Fraud control: posted **stones**, **tuning coins** (ring test), **blue-paper** emergency rates.

### Calendars (Rhythm)
- **Short Beat** (rite cadence) and **Long Beat** (six years) govern elections, vows, and legal presumptions.
- Festival timing aligns with **tideway tables**; ports post **errata leafs** after bloom years.

### Marking & Proof
- Ward **bell-year** marks on measures; compositories print **forms**; counterfeit marks → Watch courts.

_Notes:_ Subpages like `weight_stones.md`, `grain_notes.md`, and `tide_steps.md` can be added later; keep this index as the stable target.
