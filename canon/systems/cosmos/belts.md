# Belts & Small Bodies
ID: COS:BEL-001

## Karodot’s Tears
- Main-belt asteroids between Point and Karodot; meteor showers episodically visible.
- Legend: frozen “tears” of the sea-hag Karodot—poetic origin, not physical.

## Trailing Belt
- Distant, icy small bodies beyond Ze; very faint; largely theoretical in early eras.
- Navigation relevance: none for pre-modern sailors.

Cross-refs: COS:SYS-001.
