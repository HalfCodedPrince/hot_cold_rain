# Belts & Small Bodies

## Karodot’s Tears (main belt)
Main-belt asteroids between Point and Karodot; meteor showers are episodically visible. In folklore, “tears of the sea-hag Karodot.”

## Trailing Belt (distant)
Icy small bodies beyond Ze; very faint; largely theoretical to early observers. Little to no navigation relevance before modern instruments.
