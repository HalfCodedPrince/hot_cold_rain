# Belts & Small Bodies

## Karodot’s Tears (main belt)
Main-belt small bodies between Point and Karodot. Periodic meteor showers noted in coastal records and temple logs; brightness varies with stream density and geometry. In folklore, “tears of the sea-hag Karodot.”

## Trailing Belt (distant)
Icy small bodies beyond Ze. Very faint; treated as a hypothesis in early compilations, then gradually accepted as survey notes accumulated. Little to no navigation relevance before modern instruments.
