# Karodot (Gas Giant)

## Appearance & motion
Blue-white point to the unaided eye; long synodic period; faint ring; many moons (“daughters”), largest commonly called Sere-Karodot.

## Lore
Sailor proverbs tie sea moods to Karodot (non-causal folklore historically).

## Iconic plate (ERA-1797 AO)
A low-resolution **three-filter additive composite** from the one-off Peace Program probe was assembled from partial telemetry shortly before loss of signal. The image is widely reproduced in schoolbooks and temple primers.
