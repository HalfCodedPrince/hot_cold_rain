# Hex (Point’s Moon)
ID: COS:HEX-001
_Alias: previously referenced as “Ex” in early drafts._

## Physical
- Large relative diameter; tidal influence significant but not extreme.
- Albedo variations cause bright phases; green-tinge visual episodes.

## Why “green” nights happen
- Scattering through atmospheric aerosols (pollen, photic spores, dust) shifts perceived spectrum toward green under certain humidity and angle conditions.
- Not constant, often seasonal; stronger after “green rain” intervals.

## Cultural
- Tide/season omens in temple almanacs.
- “Queen’s Halo”: common ring halo reported; correlates with approaching rains.

## Cross-refs
- Hydrology & aerosols: GEO:WAT-001.
