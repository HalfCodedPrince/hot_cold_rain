# Hex (Point’s Moon)
ID: COS:HEX-001
_Alias: “Ex” in early drafts (deprecated)._

## Physical
- Large apparent size; semi-diurnal tides amplified at certain alignments (“King Tides”).
- Albedo patching yields dramatic brightness swings.

## Green nights
- Caused by scattering through atmospheric aerosols (pollen/spores/dust) under humid conditions.
- Correlates with “green rain” intervals (see GEO:WAT-001).

## Cultural
- Tide omens; “Queen’s Halo” (ring) as rain sign; morning hymns synced to Hexset before Oboe-rise.

Cross-refs: GEO:WAT-001 (hydrology), COS:SYS-001 (overview).
