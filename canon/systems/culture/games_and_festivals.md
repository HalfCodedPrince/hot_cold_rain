## Hexennial Games (The Long Beat)
**Cadence:** every 6 years (sextal “Long Beat”) • **Founded:** c. 732 AO • **Host:** rotates among major ports  
**Events (core set):**
- **Great Regatta** — oared galleys and sail-proas race the Outer Bar; timed starts to tideways.  
- **Reef Run** — teams sprint, pole-vault, and leap along exposed reef-patches at low spring tide; penalties for slips and coral chips.  
- **Stone Bell** — free-diving with a weighted “bell-stone”; longest *work below* (not just depth) wins.  
- **Net Cast** — distance + accuracy in circular casting; judged on spread and recovery.  
- **Boom-Walk** — balance duels on a wet spar over water; knock-offs only with poles.  
- **Choir Tourney** — Good Old Rhythm choirs compete on meter, breath, hand-sign; House of the Second Beat serves as jury.  
- **Compository Challenges** — press guilds race to set a standard page + staff-lines from dictation; smudge penalties.

**Betting:** licensed bookmen; odds printed as sextal tables; temple tax skimmed for charity.

## Annual & Local Festivals
- **Green Lantern Nights** — when the green rains peak, flotillas of oiled-cloth lanterns drift seaward; hymns in the Short Beat.  
- **Pilot’s Vow** — coming-of-age swim across a marked tide channel; a reef token proves the crossing.  
- **Old Song Day** — first fair wind of the season; regattas for small craft; kite-spars flown from piers.

## Everyday Sports & Pastimes
- **Crab Races** — trained shore crabs with painted shells; heats run in gutter-alleys after rain.  
- **Shell Painting** — lacquered story shells; competition themes announced by compositories each new moon.  
- **Cane-Fencing** — light stick bouts on piers; boarding-drills adapted for play.  
- **Rope Grapple** — tug and clinch on floating rafts; falls count when both feet leave the raft.  
- **Driftstones** (board game) — mancala-like counting on six pits per side; capture on the long beat (sixth move).  
- **Captains’ Lines** (strategy) — semaphore-style line-linking on a hex grid; win by connecting port to port.

## Notes for Referees & Writers
- **Cadence matters:** Scores break ties by lowest *breath count* (beats held) or *stroke count*.  
- **Public order:** choirs police their own; House of the Sixth Beat arbitrates wagers and fouls.  
- **No horses, no amphitheaters:** arenas are water-rings of lashed barges; grandstands are piers and warehouse roofs.
