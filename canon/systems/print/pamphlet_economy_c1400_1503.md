## Supply chain (how words move)
- **Rag/bast → paper** (stampers), **lampblack/oil → ink**, **type & plates** (Beat II plates vs compository sets).
- **Presses** in collegia, Crum halls (Free Cities/Free Cities), and back rooms of Mangrove Gardens (night runs).
- **Routes**: convoy holds (hidden in rope bales), **postal packets** (before monopoly), **fog-gate marts** (oath-covered bundles).

## Markets
- **Ward sheets** (gossip + satire), **choir leaves** (music + dogma), **sermonettes**, **squibs**, **lampoons**, **theater scripts**.
- Sold in **Gardens**, **taverns**, **choir schools**, and by **ship-barrow peddlers**.

## Ratings vs bans (pre-edicts)
- **Cleanliness Tables** (posted by Steps): grade pamphlets **A–D** for “riot risk” and “lane impact.” Ports use tables to **throttle** access without outright ban.
- **Beat II Seals**: official recensions; anything off-meter is “unclean” (social censorship).

## Escalation tools (late)
- **Plate Warrants**: seize plates, not piles of paper (hurts supply).  
- **Postal pulls**: yank packets mid-route; publish “missing bags” leaves.  
- **Access throttle**: lower priority for ports that host “unclean” presses.

## Smuggling & countermeasures
- **Chorister pouches**, **rope-core tubes**, **oil jars false bottoms**.
- **Split plates**: engrave meters and text separately, print in two ports, assemble at sea.
- **Fog-gate code**: use **oath-stone codes** (“reed-six”) to signal content type without titles.

## Violence & theater
- **Theater sacks** (audiences rush the stage), **choir ambushes**, **dock brawls**; assassinations are rare, targeted, and usually blamed on “unknown journeymen.”

## After the Green Edicts
- **Postal monopoly**: **Oboe Packet** licensed; rival couriers illegal.  
- **Censor plates**: Beat II master plates registered; compositories must copy numbers; off-plate = seizure.  
- **Pamphlet stamps**: per-leaf stamp (tiny tax); unstamped = contraband.  
- **Reader rolls**: collegia must file student readers by faculty; “wandering scholars” lose immunity.
