# Onomastic Suffixes

## Ordic (harbor speech & ledgers)
- **House gentilic –i / –ni / –ri**: “of House …” → Zambrani, Irri, Kelimari (variants by district).
- **Patronymic marker ben/bat** (scribe form only): Marr **ben** Marr.
- **Diminutives –et / –ot** (affection / junior): Tammis → Tammet.
- **Trade tags –wright / –book / –line** (nicknames): Netwright, Book-Nerise (rare in ledgers).

## Kllrian (temple & ridge dialects)
- **Demonym –rian / –rianne**: Kllrian, Ultrianne.
- **Rite-names** added on vows: Marak → Marak-of-Salt (liturgical contexts only).
- **Clan marks –ak / –ek** (older form; survives in highlands): Marak (clan form).

## Sar (littoral cities)
- **Toponymic “of X”**: Arsu **of Seven Fingers** (pilot-books & courts).
- **Learned second element** (scholastic / guild): Eshoron **Ir** (treat “Ir” as short house).
- **Compound glosses** for temple-garb names: Seven Fingers (“hair/comb/garb” gloss kept in place files).

## Cuzhar relics (antique)
- **Elemental epithets** attach *after* name: Nasha **of Rain**, Teyu **the Grey** (kept as epithets).

## Practical rules
- First mention: **ledger-name** + epithet if famous (Nerise Zambrani; Marr “the Skin-Grass”).
- YAML: use `naming:` block (see names_and_onomastics.md) so tools can format consistently.
