## Transportation
Courts commute sentences to **transport** (6–12 years) for colonial or state works. Contracts held by magistracy; sold-on labor is forbidden in law, common in practice.

## Camps (Reed-Camp District LOC:REED-001)
Bog-iron extraction under wardens. Waterborne disease, rot, and ration-fraud drive mortality. After the **Reed-Camp Rising (762 AO)**, wardens and garrisons settle into **protection rackets** with local elites.

## The Reed Code (post-762 AO)
- Maximum term limits reaffirmed; evade via “discipline extensions.”  
- Ration standards printed; enforcement rarely audited.  
- Death in custody triggers debt write-off; families receive no compensation.

## Oversight
Beat Six keeps **camp rolls**; inspectors rotate with convoy schedules; Censor’s Bench claims right to seize “seditionary leafs” within camps.
