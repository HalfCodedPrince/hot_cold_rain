# Slavery in Ord–Sar (c. 300–900 AO)

## Scale & Concentration
Lower than peak Rome; logistics, climate, and disease check large inland plantations. Slavery clusters in **households**, **skilled shops**, **shore estates**, and **state sites** (quarries, ore camps).

## Markets & Law
Captives and debt-bonds flow through **port auctions** under city law; temple courts adjudicate family and testimony. **Temple seals** often required for sale; **Beat Six** keeps manumission rolls.

## Roles
- **Household & service** (urban).  
- **Skilled**, often rented out (cooks, scribes, shipwrights’ assistants).  
- **Agrarian** gangs on river/volcanic estates (Sar/Klr littoral).  
- **State labor** in mines/quarries/camps (high mortality).

## Manumission
Typical routes: fee + sponsor; service milestones; military/combat service (rare). Freed often owe a **freedman’s due** (annual obligation).

## Colonial Era Note (Widiwidi/South Sar)
Empire favors **penal transportation**, **indenture**, and **compulsory local labor quotas** over mass transoceanic chattel import. This keeps focus on **coercion by jurisdiction**, not **race**. Racialized ideologies do appear in pamphlets, but **Co-Types** remain the most visible “other” in social prejudice.

## Tone & Sources
Archivally dry: mortality tables, transport lists, manumission fees. The books speak plainly; commentary is sparse, regret implicit.
