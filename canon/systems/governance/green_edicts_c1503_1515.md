## Thesis
A post-1503 administrative package that trades spectacle for procedure: cities retain public rites, but peace is achieved through **sanctuary drills, Mixed Courts, clinic hours (“Switch counseling”), standard kit**, and **plate-sealed recensions**. Not theology—coordination.

## Why issued
Harbor/dock chaos after the **Day of Green Skies**, convoy irregularities, pamphlet violence, and ward disputes over Switch Hours and kit etiquette.

## The Edicts (summary)
- **I. Sanctuaries & Clinics.** Ward sanctuaries must keep **A/B drill schedules**; publish quiet clinic windows; bursaries for Switch counseling; food & shelter ledgers audited quarterly.  
- **II. Mixed Courts.** Establish mixed civil benches for cross-rite disputes; quorum includes one **Beat VI procedure clerk**; named **torts** recognized: **membrane-pinch**, **smell-binding injury**, **cold-water negligence**.  
- **III. Calendars & Access Days.** State calendars omit Switch Hours, but **Access Days** for inspections/clinics must be harmonized with festival clocks; ports may retime festivals in green years.  
- **IV. Kit & Work Standards.** Post ward-specific kit: **wingsleeves/no armor aloft**, **vented crowns/ear-ports**, **hydro-weave with quick-drain hems**; inspectors grade crews and benches post fines.  
- **V. Texts & Plates.** Beat II reissues **recensions with marginalia**; cross-recognition permitted where side-notes suffice; Free Cities may run parallel signed slips.  
- **VI. Beacons & Signals.** Tower legs carry **aux patterns** for closures, floods, and green-rain days; benches and Works share signal books.

## Enforcement & theatre
Fines-as-theatre replace marks; **plate seals** on public postings; inspection grades displayed on beacon legs and guild doors.

## Effects by 1515
Riot frequency drops; **“Deafening → Empty Chair”** norm; sanctuary culture stabilizes; Sea-Lotus ports lead on clinic integration; print fights persist but are clerk-contained.

### Appendix A — Named torts (definitions)
- **Membrane-pinch:** any intentional or negligent contact that tears or degrades flight membrane or cuffs.  
- **Smell-binding injury:** chemical/ink exposure that impairs olfactory function in copyrooms/presses.  
- **Cold-water negligence:** failure to provide baffles, dry cords, or safe warm-up leading to hypothermia/injury.

### Appendix B — Standard ward postings (minimum)
Ear-port etiquette; wingsleeve respect; shrine rails clearance; clinic windows; beacon aux charts.
