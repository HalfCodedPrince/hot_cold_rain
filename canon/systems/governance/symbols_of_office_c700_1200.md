# Symbols of Office (Ord–Sar)

## The Oboe Seal
High Master’s matrix and ledger-keys; countersigns edicts. Held in joint lock by the **Keeper of the Oboe Seal** during the **Empty Seat**.

## The Oar-Bench Throne
A low, backless thwart from a retired flagship, bound in cane and shell, inlaid with **six** brass pins (the Beats). The High Master sits here only for oaths/proclamations; in all other sessions the bench remains **empty** to honor the office and the republic’s forms. Since the restoration, the Oar-Bench oath is performed with Beat Six and Keeper countersigns visible to the crowd.

## The Salt Chamber Drum
A short cadence drum to open/close Council sessions (Short Beat). Struck by the session clerk; not a personal badge.
