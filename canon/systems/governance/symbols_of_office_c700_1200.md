# Symbols of Office (Ord–Sar)

## The Oboe Seal
High Master’s matrix and ledger-keys; countersigns edicts. Custody is **joint lock**: **Keeper of the Oboe Seal** + **Archives Collegium** hold separate wards. During the **Empty Seat**, the Keeper holds both wards in public sight; any use requires Bench notice and crowd witnesses. Seal strokes are registered as rubbings in Archives.

## The Oar-Bench Throne
A low, backless thwart from a retired flagship, bound in cane and shell, inlaid with **six** brass pins (the Beats). The High Master sits here only for oaths and proclamations; in all other sessions the bench remains **empty** to honor the office and the republic’s forms. Since the restoration, the Oar-Bench oath is taken with **Beat Six** present and Keeper countersigns visible to the crowd.

## The Salt Chamber Drum
Session cadence drum to open and close Council sittings (**Short Beat**). Struck by the session clerk. Not a personal badge; stored in the Salt Chamber and logged out against the sitting.

## Protocols
- **Display:** Seal case closed unless an edict or oath is read; Oar-Bench remains unoccupied outside oath minutes; Drum rests silent except for open/close.  
- **Countersigns:** Keeper mark required on any edict sealed in public; Bench notice posted to the Hall door.  
- **Custody:** Archives maintains the seal book (rubbings, dates, witnesses). Council clerk keeps the Drum book (strikes, sittings).  
- **Procession:** On festival days, Bench pennant leads; Seal case follows between Keeper and an Archives warder; Oar-Bench is not carried.

## Forgeries and Replacement
- **Test:** Censorate compares stroke depth and flaw map to the Archives rubbings; false strokes are seized and burnt.  
- **Loss:** If matrix or keys are lost or seized, the Council declares an **Empty Seat** until a lawful recut; interim edicts use Bench forms without Oboe impression and expire at festival close unless renewed under seal.
