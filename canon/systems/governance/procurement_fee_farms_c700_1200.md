# Procurement & Fee-Farms (c.700–1200 AO)

## Thesis
Who buys, with what paper, and who skims. Pre-1200 procurement is **list-driven** (Works lists, convoy hours) and **rent-funded** (fee-farms). Debt Office paper bridges the gap; Steps and Watches price the risk.

## What Gets Procured
- **Public works:** oil, wick, rope, iron caps, stone, timber; dredge craft hire.
- **Security:** escort hours, powder, swivels, pilots’ time; later, small bombards.
- **Relief:** grain rails, ferry space, fuel.
- **Printing:** posted lists, festival dockets, warrants.

## Tender Cycle (canonical)
1) **Works** posts a **List of Needs** (printed leaf: item, quantity, cap, window, seal).  
2) **Debt Office** issues or rolls a **stair** to match the cap; assigns fee-farm rents as service.  
3) **Watches** certify **Access Days** and berths so winners can actually deliver.  
4) **Insurers (Steps)** sign **Rate-Hold** endorsements to freeze convoy premiums during delivery.  
5) **Keeper** stamps; bids lodged via the **Courier Circuit**; results posted; bags filed.  
6) **Warehouses** receive; **Assay Ring** verifies measures/metals; invoices settle at **festival close**.

## Fee-Farms (mechanic)
- **Definition:** right to collect a defined fee (wharfage, dockets) for a fixed rent to the Debt Office.  
- **Why:** smooths center cashflow; pushes collection risk to farm-holders; creates patronage leverage.  
- **Books:** farm-holder keeps **charge & discharge** day-book; rent due by festival.  
- **Transfer:** farms can be pledged; re-assignment requires **Keeper** countersign.

## Controls (the audit triangle)
- **Issuer (Works/Bench)** ≠ **Collector (Farm/Watches)** ≠ **Auditor (Debt/Keeper)**.  
- **Censors’ Bench** conducts spot checks, bans, and license pulls when drift appears.  
- Reconcile at festival: issuer totals (lists) vs collector day-books vs auditor rent ledger.

## Known Pathologies
- **Bid rotation & ghost bidders** (printed leaves deter some; not all).  
- **Farm skimming & arrears** (rents drift; farms repossessed at festival—often violent).  
- **Double-pledged notes** (same stair promised to two lists).  
- **Escort leakage** (letters of marque morph into standing escort contracts without tender).

## Interfaces
- **Economy:** fee-farm rents and toll streams service Debt Office stairs.  
- **Courier/Assay:** tender bags and assay slips are the nervous system; late bags spike rates.  
- **Warehouses:** redemption proves delivery and closes invoices.  
- **Metrology:** calendar and measures fix posting windows and festival closings.

## Complexity Dial
- **Core wards:** printed tenders; public posting; three-office custody; festival closings consistent.  
- **Near-coast:** mixed (some printed, some hand-lists); partial custody separation.  
- **Interior:** verbal tenders; farms are personal grants; reconciliation is narrative, not numeric.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Works List (WL-L):** item, qty, cap, delivery window, seal.  
- **Farm Deed (FF-D):** fee stream, rent, term, pledges, countersigns.  
- **Rate-Hold (RH-S):** insurer endorsement freezing convoy premiums during delivery.  
- **Festival Close (FC-R):** reconciliation sheet (issuer/collector/auditor tallies).
