## Thesis
Who buys, with what paper, and who skims. Pre-1200 procurement is **list-driven** (Works lists, convoy hours) and **rent-funded** (fee-farms). Debt Office paper bridges the gap; Steps and Watches price the risk.

## What Gets Procured
- **Public works:** oil, wick, rope, iron caps, stone, timber; dredge craft hire.
- **Security:** escort hours, powder, swivels, pilots’ time; later, small bombards.
- **Relief:** grain rails, ferry space, fuel.

## Tender Cycle (canonical)
1) **Works** posts a **List of Needs** (printed leaf; item, quantity, cap).
2) **Debt Office** issues or rolls a **stair** to match the cap; assigns fee-farm rents as service.
3) **Watches** certify **Access Days** and berths to avoid auction winners who can’t deliver.
4) **Insurers (Steps)** sign **Rate-Hold** endorsements to keep premiums stable during the tender.
5) **Keeper** stamps; bids lodged via the **Courier Circuit**; results posted; bags filed.
6) **Warehouses** receive goods; **Assay Ring** verifies measures/metals; invoices settle on festival close.

## Fee-Farms (mechanic)
- **Definition:** right to collect a defined fee (wharfage, dockets) in exchange for a fixed rent to the Debt Office.
- **Why:** smooths center cashflow; pushes collection risk to farm-holders; creates patronage leverage.
- **Books:** farm-holder keeps **charge & discharge** day-book; rent due by festival.
- **Transfer:** farms can be pledged; re-assignment requires Keeper countersign.

## Controls (the “audit triangle”)
- **Issuer (Works/Bench)** ≠ **Collector (Farm/Watches)** ≠ **Auditor (Debt/Keeper)**.
- Reconciliation at festival: issuer totals (lists) vs. collector day-books vs. auditor rent ledger.

## Known Pathologies
- **Bid rotation & ghost bidders** (printed leaves fix some of this; not all).
- **Farm skimming & arrears** (rents drift; farms repossessed at festival—often violently).
- **Double-pledged notes** (same stair promised to two lists).
- **Escort leakage** (letters of marque morph into standing escort contracts without tender).

## Interfaces
- **Economy:** fee-farm rents and toll streams back Debt Office stairs.
- **Courier/Assay:** tender bags & assay slips are the nervous system; late bags cause rate spikes.
- **Warehouses:** redemption proves delivery and closes invoices.

## Complexity Dial
- **Core wards:** printed tenders; public posting; three-office custody; festival closings consistent.
- **Near-coast:** mixed (some printed, some hand-lists); partial custody separation.
- **Interior:** verbal tenders; farms are personal grants; reconciliation is narrative, not numeric.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Works List (WL-L):** item, qty, cap, delivery window, seal.
- **Farm Deed (FF-D):** fee stream, rent, term, pledges, countersigns.
- **Rate-Hold (RH-S):** insurer endorsement freezing convoy premiums during delivery.
- **Festival Close (FC-R):** reconciliation sheet (issuer/collector/auditor tallies).
