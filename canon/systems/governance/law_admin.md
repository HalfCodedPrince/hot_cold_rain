# Law & Administration — From Captains to Diet

## Thesis
Maritime needs (convoys, quarantine, tolls) grew a **harbor-first legal order**: city councils, temple courts, and watch offices. In the Grand Principate the **Diet** and **Emperor-arbiter** formalized it; stalemate in the late Principate re-localized day-to-day power in councils and benches.

## Structures (who runs what)
- **Council of Captains** (Ord): merchant-naval oligarchy; elects **High Master** in emergencies. Provincial **Harbor Prefects** (tax/dredge/quarantine) and **Canal Wardens** (locks/fees).
- **Diet & Principate** (Grand Principate): estates/cities; Emperor as arbiter; **chronic deadlock** late GP.

## Domains (what the law covers)
- **Maritime:** registry; salvage & wreck; pilotage; bottomry/respondentia.
- **Markets:** weights/measures; guild charters; port warrants.
- **Public order:** storm curfews; levee trespass; canal sabotage (capital in wartime).

## Courts & Policing (how it’s enforced)
- **Circuit Judges** (temple boats); **Harbor Watch**; **Riverine Guard**. Evidence culture: **seal rolls**, **shell-impress**, and sworn **oboe call** in oaths.

## Practices & Forms
- **Warrants & Notes:** metrology standards referenced on forms; port warrants tie to convoy calendars.  
- **Elections & Interregna:** see the **Empty Seat** page for absence law and **Edict of the Long Beat** procedures.

## Risks / Failure Modes
- **Stalemate:** Diet vetoes; princes govern by delay.  
- **Capture:** Harbor offices rent-seek; watch bribery in lean years.  
- **Distance law:** inland cases lag; temple boats stretch circuits.
