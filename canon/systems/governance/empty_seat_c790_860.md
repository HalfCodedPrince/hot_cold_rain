# The Empty Seat — Interregnal Governance in Ord–Sar

## Problem
When the **High Master** is absent with **no proof of death** (no body, no confession, no dispositive temple lot), state action stalls: edicts cannot be countersigned, treasuries cannot disburse, and elections cannot complete.

## Interim Control — “The Three Seals”
Until the **Edict of the Long Beat** (789 AO), practice hardened into a triad:
- **Council Seal** — **Council of Captains** (FAC:COC-001): fleets, patrols, convoy writs.
- **Temple Seal** — **House of the Sixth Beat** (FAC:BEAT-006): courts, proscriptions, discipline.
- **Chancery Seal** — **Grain Chancery** (FAC:CHA-001): notes, tariffs, market measures.

Any act crossing spheres requires **two of three seals**; coinage changes require **all three**.

## Keeper of the Oboe Seal (FAC:KOS-001)
An elected goverment office holding the High Master’s matrix and ledger-keys under joint lock (Council + Beat Six). The Keeper may **certify absence**, **sequester tainted seals**, and **register interim acts**. The Keeper **cannot proclaim** a successor.

## Elections & Forms
The **High Master remains an elected magistracy**. In absence, the Council may **call an election** only when either:
1) death is proved; or  
2) the **Edict of the Long Beat** deems absence equivalent to death for legal purposes.

Festival closures reconcile registers; interim acts entered by the Keeper do not lapse at close.

The fiction of the republic—**Council first, magistrate second**—is maintained even as practical power centralizes.

## Adjudication & Lots
Temple **lots** may be cast; persuasive but not dispositive. Harbor Watches and the **Censor’s Bench** gather depositions; evidence is often destroyed under panic.

## Failure Modes (783–789 AO)
- **Sess**
