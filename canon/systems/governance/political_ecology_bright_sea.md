# Political Ecology of the Bright Sea

## Why Cities Rule the Sea (and Not the Land)
- Indented coasts + reefs → many discrete harbors (natural nodes).
- Jungle interior + green rain → high road maintenance, rot, disease.
- No horse logistics → sea remains the highway.

## City-State Equilibrium
- Port treasuries (pilotage, salt, reef trade, compositories) fund walls/militias.
- Temples arbitrate ritual and law across cities but field few troops.
- Empires grow as strings (ports, straits, bars), not carpets.

## Centralization Thresholds
- Beacon Chain + Line of Hands increase administrative radius.
- Rhythm calendar + measures enable taxation and courts at distance.
- Finance (convoy insurance, grain notes) ties treasuries—until panics.

## Result
A thalassocratic federation: many cities with councils under imperial licenses, harmonized by calendar and contracts, policed at the waterline.
