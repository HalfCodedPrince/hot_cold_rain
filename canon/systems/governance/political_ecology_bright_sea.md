# Political Ecology of the Bright Sea

## Thesis
Fragmented coasts and hostile interiors keep power maritime. Ports form the state. The sea is the road.

## Overview
Indented shores and reefs create discrete harbors that act as natural nodes. Jungle interiors and green-rain rot break roads and carts. No horse logistics worth the upkeep. Cargo and law move fastest by water. Settlement chains grow along bars and straits, not as inland carpets.

## Institutions / Actors
- **Port treasuries** fund walls, beacons, dredge and bar works, and paid watches via pilotage, salt dues, reef rights, and compository fees.  
- **Temples and houses** arbitrate ritual and intercity law. They field few troops and lean on harbor watches for force.  
- **Harbor watches** police the waterline and convoy musters.  
- **Council of Captains** coordinates straits access, seasonal entries, and convoy timing when risk is high.

## Practices / Law
- **Licenses and charters** bind city councils to imperial forms. Harbor jurisdictions end at the bar and the beam.  
- **Calendar and measures** from metrology make distant courts and taxes legible. Beacon chains and the **Line of Hands** extend an administrative radius along coasts and islets.  
- **Record and seal** practice runs through compositories and port chanceries for cargo, debt, and salvage.

## Economics / Logistics
- **Finance coupling** links ports through convoy insurance, grain notes, and public debt issuance. Cheap sea lift dominates bulk flows.  
- **Risk pricing** sets convoy cadence, night-entry doctrine, and which bars to cut this season.  
- **String geometry** wins. Control the narrow, the roadstead, and the signal hill. Ignore hinterlands that cannot feed a pier.

## Risks / Failure Modes
- **Channel failure** from silt, storm, or war closes a bar and starves a string of ports.  
- **Standards drift** breaks schedules when calendar or measures diverge.  
- **Panic cascades** run through insurers, treasuries, and grain offices faster than any levy can move.  
- **Temple split** removes arbitration and turns dues into tribute at gunwale range.

## Result
A thalassocratic federation of city councils under imperial licenses. Harmonized by calendar and contracts. Policed at the waterline. Growth proceeds as strings of ports across bars and straits.
