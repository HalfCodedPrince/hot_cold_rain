# Political Ecology of the Bright Sea

## Why cities rule the sea (and not the land)
Indented coasts + reefs create many discrete harbors (natural nodes); jungle interiors + green-rain rot and disease make roads fragile; no horse logistics—**sea remains the highway**.

## City-state equilibrium
Port treasuries (pilotage, salt, reef trade, compositories) fund walls and militias. Temples arbitrate ritual/law across cities but field few troops. Empires grow as **strings** (ports/straits/bars), not carpets.

## Centralization thresholds
Beacon chains and **Line of Hands** extend administrative radius; Rhythm calendar + measures enable courts and taxation at distance; finance (convoy insurance; grain notes) ties treasuries—until panics.

## Result
A thalassocratic federation: many city councils under imperial licenses, harmonized by calendar and contracts, policed at the waterline.
