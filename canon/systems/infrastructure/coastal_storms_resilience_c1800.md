## Setting Impacts
- **Typhoon belts:** Coi-Hi and peer ports take regular hits; flood-prone tracts nearest the sea host **spawning markets** that relocate inland after storms.
- **Corruption drag:** seawalls under-specced; flood maps suppressed; “emergency funds” skimmed.
- **Rare tsunamis:** leave **pier skeletons** and shell-studded asphalt; hilltop communal tombs mark losses.

## Mitigation (when civic will exists)
- **Green buffers:** mangrove belts, reef restoration, dune fences.
- **Built form:** elevated arcades; **breakaway facades**; sacrificial ground floors; hilltop **strongholds** (schools/temples) with cisterns and radios.
- **Signals mesh:** horn codes, bell sequences, lantern ladders; school drills by festival cycle.
