## Thesis
Paper and metal only “work” because couriers, clocks, and scales do. This page defines the **sealed courier circuit** that moves writs, notes, and tickets between benches, and the **assay ring** (licensed testers, weights, and stamps) that keeps coin/ingot trustable along the coast.

## Network Topology
- **Spines:** Blue-lit ports (Steps, Debt Office desks, Works yards) linked by fixed-day courier runs.
- **Ribs:** Near-coast towns and major river lifts served 1–3 festivals out of 4.
- **Nodes:** Bench houses, warrant warehouses, and assay stalls; each node posts *Receive/Dispatch Hours*.

## Seals, Timings, Custody
- **Seal grammar:** Outer ribbon (origin bench), inner wafer (duty office), *oboe* counter-mark (Keeper) for high-value bags.
- **Runbooks:** Each bag carries a *ticket-list* (contents digest) and a *clock strip* (dispatch/arrival scratches).
- **Handovers:** Three signatures—sender clerk, courier, receiver clerk—plus *counter-seal* if the bag is reopened.

## Assay & Weights
- **Licensed ring:** Assay masters hold *touch plates* and issue **assay slips** (mass/fineness, fee paid).
- **Standard kit:** beam scale, nested weights, needle, stone; measures traced back to Metrology.
- **Coin rules:** clipped or sweated coin is bagged with a red wafer; redeemable only at assay rate.

## What Actually Moves
- **Paper:** convoy tickets, grain notes, bench-dockets, dredge/beacon notes, claims dossiers, tender lists.
- **Metal & goods:** duty oil chests, iron caps/rope coils (to Works), emergency grain for festivals.

## Failure Modes (and Their Smells)
- **Clock drift:** late bags void same-day tenders; premiums tick up at the Steps.
- **Seal hopping:** re-sealed bags without counter-marks; fixed by *two-seal* rule on high-value routes.
- **Assay fraud:** salted samples; corrected by random *split assay* (two stalls, reconciled at festival close).

## Interfaces
- **Debt Office:** validates maturities by *clock strip*; late endorsements require Keeper countersign.
- **Insurers (Steps):** do rate resets at courier arrival bells; whistle leaves often cite *missing bags*.
- **Works:** oil/rope call-offs ride the same bags as fee lists to reduce lead time.

## Complexity Dial (core → rim)
- **Core wards:** daily runs; two licensed assay stalls; same-festival redress possible.
- **Near-coast:** twice-weekly runs; single stall; redress at next festival only.
- **Interior/passes:** ad-hoc riders; assay by itinerant smiths; paper usually hand-copied, not sealed.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Clock Strip (CLSTR-A):** narrow glued slip listing time & clerk marks.
- **Assay Slip (ASL-B):** 1/6-sheet with mass, fineness, fee, stall mark.
- **Ticket-List (TL-D):** bag inventory (writ codes, count, originating desks).
