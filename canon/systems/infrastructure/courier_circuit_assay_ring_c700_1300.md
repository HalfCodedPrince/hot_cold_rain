# Courier Circuit & Assay Ring (c.700–1300 AO)

## Thesis
Paper and metal only “work” because couriers, clocks, and scales do. The **sealed courier circuit** moves writs, notes, tickets, and lists between benches. The **assay ring** (licensed testers, weights, stamps) keeps coin, ingot, and bar trustable along the coast.

## Network Topology
- **Spines:** blue-lit ports (Steps desk, Debt Office window, Works yard) on fixed-day runs.  
- **Ribs:** near-coast towns and major river lifts served one to three festivals out of four.  
- **Nodes:** bench houses, warrant warehouses, assay stalls; each posts **Receive / Dispatch Hours**.  
- **Beacons & bells:** navigation lights and harbor bells time entries; dispatch follows flood and moon.

## Seals, Timings, Custody
- **Seal grammar:** outer ribbon = origin bench; inner wafer = duty office; **oboe** counter-mark (Keeper) for high-value bags.  
- **Runbooks:** each bag carries a **ticket-list** (contents digest) and a **clock strip** (dispatch/arrival scratches).  
- **Handovers:** three signatures—sender clerk, courier, receiver clerk; add **counter-seal** if a bag is opened in transit.  
- **Two-seal rule:** high-value routes require origin + way-station seal to deter reseals.  
- **Posting:** dispatch boards (printed or chalk) list bag codes and missed connections.

## Assay & Weights
- **Licensed ring:** assay masters hold touch plates and issue **assay slips** (mass/fineness, fee).  
- **Standard kit:** beam, nested weights, needle, stone; measures trace to **Metrology**.  
- **Coin rules:** clipped or sweated coin is bagged with a red wafer and redeems only at assay rate.  
- **Split assay:** random dual-stall tests reconcile at festival close; slips are cross-referenced to bag codes.

## What Moves
- **Paper:** convoy tickets, grain notes, bench dockets, dredge/beacon notes, claims dossiers, tender lists.  
- **Metal / goods:** duty oil chests, iron caps, rope coils (Works), emergency grain, assay samples, stamped bars.

## Operating Calendar
- **Festival rhythm:** maturities, reconciliations, and redress align to festival closes.  
- **Access Days:** watches publish safe-entry windows; courier boats use the same to cut delays.  
- **Drift control:** bell times and printed tide-tables anchor **clock strip** standards.

## Failure Modes
- **Clock drift:** late bags void same-day tenders; premiums tick up at the **Steps**.  
- **Seal hopping:** reseal without counter-mark; fixed by two-seal + clerk witness at way-stations.  
- **Assay fraud:** salted samples; **split assay** and surprise weigh-checks catch variance.  
- **Bag loss:** river breach or reef; ticket-list duplicates in next run allow partial redress.

## Interfaces
- **Debt Office:** validates maturities by **clock strip**; late endorsements need **Keeper** countersign.  
- **Insurers (Steps):** rate resets at courier bells; whistle leaves cite **missing bags** and **assay drifts**.  
- **Works:** oil/rope call-offs ride with fee lists to cut lead time; beacon and dredge notes share bags.  
- **Law:** seal misuse and bag tamper fall to harbor law; redress windows posted per **law**.  
- **Printing:** leaves for schedules, notices, and forms keep boards legible in core wards.  
- **Navigation:** current notes and roadstead signals set dispatch cadence and river lift timing.

## Complexity Dial (core → rim)
- **Core wards:** daily runs; two licensed assay stalls; same-festival redress.  
- **Near-coast:** twice-weekly runs; single stall; redress next festival.  
- **Interior / passes:** ad-hoc riders; itinerant smiths assay; paper often hand-copied, not sealed.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Clock Strip (CLSTR-A):** narrow glued slip with time marks and clerk scratches.  
- **Assay Slip (ASL-B):** 1/6-sheet listing mass, fineness, fee, stall mark.  
- **Ticket-List (TL-D):** bag inventory (writ codes, count, originating desks).  
- **Counter-Seal Notice (CS-N):** reason, place, witness for in-transit opens.
