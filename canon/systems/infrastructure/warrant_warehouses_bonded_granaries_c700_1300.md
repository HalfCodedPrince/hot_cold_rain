## Thesis
These are the **physical endpoints** for scrip: places where **grain notes**, **oil warrants**, and **Works lists** turn back into food, light, and iron. Warehouses also collateralize Debt Office paper and stabilize convoy provisioning.

## Types & Roles
- **Bonded Granaries:** levy grain in; issue **grain notes** by weight/season; redeem inside core wards.
- **Beacon-Oil Depots:** sealed amphorae; track **Works oil lists** and wick bundles.
- **Iron & Rope Sheds:** iron caps, bar, rope; reserved first for dredge/beacon legs and escort fittings.

## Receipts & Warrants
- **Receipt grammar:** serial, weight/measure, season code, warehouse stamp; contra-entry at redemption.
- **Transferability:** within city limits by endorsement; outside by re-issue only (to curb arbitrage).
- **Fee tables:** posted by ward bench (*bench-dockets*); storage and shrinkage fees itemized.

## How Redemption Works
1) Clerk checks serial against the **warehouse book** (and courier *ticket-list* for remote issues).
2) Weigh/measure; apply assay when metal is involved.
3) Endorse redemption; tear-off for the Debt/Works day-book.

## Controls
- **Stock-takes:** festival counts; Keeper spot checks.
- **Locks:** triple custody—warehouseman, ward clerk, Works inspector.
- **Spoilage:** rat/flood losses booked to **shrinkage**; anything beyond *posted tolerance* triggers inquiry.

## Failure Modes
- **Phantom stock:** receipts issued without stock; detected at festival count.
- **Over-endorsement:** same note redeemed twice; fixed by *countersign* at re-issue.
- **Hinterland refusal:** grain notes discount badly inland; relief convoys use mixed writs instead.

## Complexity Dial
- **Core wards:** full tri-lock warehouses; same-festival redemption; daily stock cards.
- **Near-coast:** single-lock under ward clerk; redemption on fixed market days.
- **Interior:** patron barns with hand-lists; receipts honored only by the issuing lord/bench.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Granary Receipt (GRN-R):** 1/8-sheet; weight, season, stamp.
- **Oil Warrant (OIL-W):** 1/4-sheet; amphora count, wick book ref, Works mark.
- **Stock Card (STK-C):** hanging slate; daily ins/outs; totals copied at festival close.
