## Collection
Handcarts, donkey carts, small lorries, **trash boats** for canal belts. Scavengers (kids, elders) pre-sort for resale.

## Disposal
- **Landfills** on higher outskirts; sometimes just open mounds, sometimes burned.
- **Incinerators** in rich/government wards; frequent breakdowns.
- **Temp dumps** after floods pile rot and pests inside the city.

## Politics
Hauling contracts = patronage & rackets; markets reek after green rain; rows over whose turn to crew the trash boat.
