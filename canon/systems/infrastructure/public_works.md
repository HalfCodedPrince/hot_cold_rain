# Public Works Beyond Sewers

## Water & Shore
- **Green Seawalls** — mangrove palisades and brush-matt fascines that bind mudflats; maintained by Fifth Beat charities and dock guilds.  
- **Reef-Keys (Block Reefs)** — stacked coral-stone/slag blocks that seed new reef bars; break swell and protect inner harbors.  
- **Outer-Bar Dredges & Slipways** — civic drydocks, hauled by capstan; standardized cradles since late Zambranic era.  
- **Rainwrights’ Cisterns** — public cisterns under granaries and squares; oiled-lime vaults; temple seals certify potability.

## Signals & Measures
- **Beacon Chain** — fire/lantern towers from headlands to capes; fog-bells and conch-horns for low visibility.  
- **Line of Hands** — semaphore masts on warehouse roofs; port-to-port signal lexicon derived from the flag code; later extends inland to courts and granaries.  
- **Measure Stones** — sextal standard posts (length, weight, volume) set in markets; annual re-chalking during the calendar rites.

## Health & Safety
- **Lazarettos** — quarantine isles at harbor mouths; oiled-cloth wards, fumigation kilns, and tide-flushed jetties.  
- **Storm-Houses** — raised, stone-pillared shelters with food/water caches; keys held by Beat Six and ward captains.

## Industry & Supply
- **Ropewalks & Sail-lofts** — long covered sheds for cordage and cloth; civic loans backed by convoy tariffs.  
- **Flood Granaries** — stilted storehouses with tide-stairs; grain notes redeemable at Chancery.

## Civic–Temple Interface
- Public works are **blessed and audited**: Beats Five and Six keep the registers; compositories print inspection leafs; failure to maintain a ward or wall draws temple censure *and* court fines.
