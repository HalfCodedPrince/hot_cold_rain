# Public Works — Beacons, Seawalls & Cisterns

## Thesis
Ports run on **light, edges, and water**: beacons for timing, seawalls for shape, cisterns for life. The works bind the climate to the ledger. 

## Overview
- **Beacons & bells** align with seasonal lanes; radio huts at capes triangulate entries.  
- **Seawalls** and **spit-reef quays** fix channel geometry; dredging cycles follow the Old Song.  
- **Quays & cranes** standardize the **two-crew lift**; **storm-overbuild** prevents cascading loss.  
- **Cisterns** (slow-sand + chlorination) feed blue-tag taps; **canal ladders** lift water inland. 

## Institutions / actors
- **Office of Imperial Works** charters projects; cities maintain; **harbor watches** keep the bells.  
- **Temple clinics** and **storm depots** ride the same tram/cable nodes for mass care. 

## Practices & standards
- **Navigation packages** print tide tables, light lists, horn charts; bells ring on wet air shifts.  
- **Reef-quay slotting** sets berth sizes; **tram/cable** hubs double as care nodes. 

## Economics / logistics
- Dredge debt rises if **variance** in the Old Song nudges bars; premiums respond. 

## Risks / failure modes
- **Silt misplacement** after “successful” walls; neglected fog-bell cleaning in green-rain season.  
- Inland **pipeline/cistern** contamination without regular sand change.
