# Piracy, Convoys & Navies
ID: SEC:NAV-001
Status: WIP

## Threat model
- Fast skiffs from island arcs; boarding at dusk/dawn; corruption at minor ports.
- Widiwidi arcs: volcanic lee coves; ash years spike attacks.

## Defenses
- **Convoys** with layered hulls (tug, barges, picket boats); signal codes by flag/whistle.
- **Letters of Marque** for licensed escorts; black‑hull Q‑boats disguise as freighters.
- Coastal forts at river mouths; radio triangulation posts along headlands.

## Legal & insurance
- Prize Courts (Diet/Temple mixed panels); salvage shares; convoy insurance pools.
- Too‑Kahet banks demand approved route plans + storm windows for cover.

## Economics
- Protection dues vs. tariff relief; effect on staple prices; feast/famine cycles in closures.
