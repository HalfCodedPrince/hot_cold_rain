## Thesis
There are no standing national navies; there are **compacts**—syndicated escorts grown from letters of marque, paid by **subscription** and stabilized by **Rate-Holds**. Opposing them are **mangrove benches** and short-lived “pirate republics,” which flash and die because they lack bonded stock and assay.

## Actors
- **Escort Compacts (“subscription navies”)** — merchant houses × Watches × powder suppliers; operate under multi-bench charters; financed via fee-farm rents + Debt stair; premiums rate-held by Insurers.
- **Privateers** — single-bench marque holders; fold into compacts during high-rate seasons.
- **Pirate Benches** — seasonal raiding councils occupying mangrove chokes/reef cuts; sustain on plunder until granaries fail.
- **“Republics”** — benches that attempt civil forms (dock rules, tolls); usually collapse in <1 year from grain/assay deficits.

## Doctrine & Tactics
**Pirates**
- **Terrain:** tide-timed mangrove creeks; drift-net booms; **reef dyes** to mark safe slits.
- **Weapons:** swivels with case/chain; line-guns with grapnels; firepots; smokes; cutting oars.
- **Method:** dusk ambush, two-point grapnel, scuttle or strip, vanish on ebb.

**Compacts**
- **Formation:** wedge or box under trumpet codes; storm rules override pursuit.
- **Weapons:** swivels forward; short bombards amidships on larger escorts; dye-pots to mark lanes for followers.
- **Method:** no-chase beyond convoy radius; **Access Days** pre-booked at nodes; prize courts operate under bench-dockets.

## Logistics (why pirates lose long campaigns)
- No **bonded granary** → grain scrip discounts to zero; hunger within weeks.
- No **assay ring** → coin clipped/sweated; suppliers demand pay “on the nail.”
- Powder and wick bottlenecks; without sulfur/wick imports (Widiwidi), rates eat them alive.

## Countermeasures & Law
- **Rate-Holds:** insurers freeze premiums for escorted lanes during tenders; draws ships into convoys.
- **Sanctuary penalties:** **Blue Papers** post punitive rates on benches that host pirate slips.
- **Marque creep:** temporary guards become standing escort compacts; courts tolerate because rates drop.
- **Amnesties:** labor drafts to Works yards or Koi-Hi in exchange for surrender of slips.

## Pirate Republics (mechanic)
- **Birth:** capture a reef-cut + seize a dyked granary + print a bench-docket.
- **Peak:** 1–2 festivals; collect “fees,” run out of oil/wick, coin discounts emerge.
- **Death:** famine + counter-convoy; files burned; surviving slips fold into compacts or vanish inland.

## Complexity Dial (core → rim)
- **Core wards:** compacts dominant; pirates opportunistic; prize courts active.
- **Near-coast:** mixed; pirates exploit gaps; escorts intermittent.
- **Interior/passes:** river raiding; no compacts; law by lordship and levy.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **Rate-Hold (RH-S)** — insurer endorsement freezing premiums along a lane for two festivals.
- **Pirate Bench Circular (PBC-M)** — broadside asserting “dock rules” and fee posts (usually mocked).
- **Amnesty Leaf (AMN-K)** — ward offer: surrender slips, receive labor billet and grain script.
