## Scope & Thesis
Volcanic **pozzolan** blended with hot lime gives a **hydraulic mortar** that cures in spray and even underwater—perfect for **seawalls, slipways, beacon foundations, cisterns**. This page standardizes grading, mixes, site practice, and the paperwork that lets Works buy and trust it.

## Sourcing & Grading
- **Sources:** volcanic ash (Widiwidi rim), pumice fines, kiln-ground scoria.
- **Grades:**  
  - **Pozzolan A (fine):** passes tight sieve; underwater/splash joints.  
  - **Pozzolan B (coarse):** bulk masonry/stem fills.  
- **Assay slip (POZ-ASL):** fineness index, soluble salts rating, mass/volume, stall mark.

## Lime & Aggregates
- **Lime:** shell/limestone burnt in clamp or draw kilns → **quicklime** → **hot-slaked** to putty.  
- **Aggregates:** washed **river sand** (preferred), or shell sand for light mixes.

## Mix Designs (by volume boxes)
- **Underwater joints:** `1 hot lime putty : 2 Pozzolan A : 3–4 fine sand` (stiff).  
- **Splash zone / quay caps:** `1 : 1 Pozzolan A/B : 4–5 sand`.  
- **Mass pours (bagwork):** `1 : 1.5 Pozzolan B : 5–6 mixed aggregate` (rammed in place).

> **Rule of thumb:** If the trowel slumps, it’s too wet. Strength lives in **putty + pozzolan**, not water.

## Placement Methods
- **Bagwork:** canvas sacks prefilled; placed/tamped below water; cut flush after set.  
- **Cloth formers:** hemp sleeves stuffed and rammed for tidal joints.  
- **Timber cribs:** pozzolan fill poured into crib cells for fast quay raise.  
- **Scarf joints:** feathered beds on old work; scrub and pre-wet to avoid dry suction.

## Curing & Protection
- **Keep damp & shaded 14+ days**; protect from wash with fascines/mats.  
- **Cold caution:** in frost, build windbreaks; warm mix water; delay tidal sets.

## Quality & Failure Modes
- **Job tests:** brine-drop ball (A should hold shape), scratch-set at 24h, pry test at 7d.  
- **Salts:** sharp ash? wash & drain before batching.  
- **Failures:**  
  - *Dusting surface* → mix too wet / sand too rounded.  
  - *Map cracking* → over-rich pozzolan, no damp cure.  
  - *Expansion* → sulfate contamination; reject batch (assay slip “S-high”).

## Logistics & Paper
- **Barrels & seals:** dry-kept, bung-waxed; **courier bags** carry slips and tally lists.  
- **Warehouses:** redeem **Works tickets** for sealed barrels; post shrinkage loss.  
- **Works Lists (spec tokens):** “**Pozzolan-A** (sealed), **Pozzolan-B**, **hot lime putty**, **river sand (washed)**.”

## Interfaces
- **Works:** specifies grade & window in tenders; inspects scarf prep.  
- **Procurement:** fee-farm rents service stair that funds lime burn & barrel stock.  
- **Assay/Metrology:** stall certifies fineness/salts; keeps standard sieves and brine for tests.

## Forms (diegetic)
- **POZ-ASL:** assay slip (grade, fineness, salts, fee).  
- **WL-L excerpt:** “Pozzolan-A 30 brl (sealed), Pozzolan-B 40, Hot-lime putty 20 tubs, River sand 60 loads.”  
- **Set Book (SET-M):** date, weather, tide, bay number, crew marks, 7-day/14-day checks.

## Quick Gloss
- **bagwork:** underwater placement using filled sacks as stay-in-place “forms.”  
- **hot lime:** freshly slaked, still-warm lime putty—more reactive with pozzolan.
