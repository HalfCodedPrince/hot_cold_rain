## Thesis
Manufacture scales up by **benches, bonds, and seasons**, not by steam. Long sheds, water/tidal wheels, stampers and tilt hammers power rope, sail, paper, powder, and iron—timed to monsoons and Access Days.

## Organization
- **Putting-out** for cloth & simple goods; **manufactories** (40–200 hands) for rope, sail, paper, powder, iron.  
- Paid via **Works Lists** and convoy calendars; stocked from bonded warehouses.

## Power & Plant
- **River/tidal mills**, spit windmills, tread/capstans.  
- **Stilted sheds**, louvered walls, charcoal-lime drying lofts.

## Sectors
- **Rope & sail:** ropewalks (tar/kilns), sail lofts (wax/resin finish).  
- **Paper & print:** water stampers; compositories feed collegia/benches.  
- **Powder:** warm **nitraries**; edge-runners; **corning houses** with shellac grains.  
- **Iron:** **tataras** → blooms; **tilt hammers** → bar grades (◇I/II/III).  
- **Sugar/rum:** animal/river mills; excise proof.  
- **Yards:** reef-galleon hulls; block-shops; cooperage; graving docks.

## Climate Discipline
Dry-season spin/weave/paper; wet-season stamp/corn/burn. Limewash, tannins, and resin keep mold at bay.

## Failure Modes
- **Green Years** spoilage; charcoal runouts; queue corruption.  
- Fixes: **Green-Scrip** work, charcoal reserves, Cleanliness Tables.
