## Thesis
Metal output rises in the pamphlet century not by miracle furnaces but by **discipline**: measured heats, charcoal husbandry, proof tests, and civic posting. After 1503, **Mixed Courts + Green Edicts** make inspection and safety a civic ritual, trading spectacle punishments for **fines-as-theatre** and posted grades.

## Shop Types (rules-of-thumb)
- **Bloomery & finery.** Bulk wrought iron; proof by bend/peen/file; quench only for tools.  
- **Hearth/carburizing pits.** Case-hardening for edges/springs; pack cementation with sealed boxes.  
- **Crucible rooms (rare).** Small high-grade heats in rich ports; guarded recipes and higher-fuel cost.

## Inputs & Fuel
Bog iron and river ores (sand/limonite) near polders; limestone for flux; **charcoal** by quota (ward caps); ash kept for lye in pickling/cleaning. River sheds prefer steady water and easy barge access.

## Heat Discipline (guild rubric)
- **Charge & burden.** Tables posted at the bench; impurities noted in chalk on the wall.  
- **Wind & draw.** Bellows cadence logged (apprentice duty); stack color recorded at the hour.  
- **Color & spark.** Pull/quench rules by heat color and spark length; supervisors sign the hourbook.  
- **Proof tests.** File, bend, ring; proof stamps struck on site; rejects re-melted or marked “yard only.”

## Safety, Law & Posting
- **Edicts & ward codes.** Rails, drains, hooded stacks required; **Access Day** inspections schedule quench/fire drills and spill drills.  
- **Mixed Courts.** Hear burns, roof fires, and “bad iron” injury suits; Free Cities lean to **fines** over brands; repeat neglect escalates to closures.  
- **Beacon-leg postings.** Closures and grade letters posted on beacon legs and guild doors; re-opening needs an inspector’s seal.

## Labor & Organization
Apprentice ladders under sworn masters; quiet lanes through sheds; shrine rails near hammers; night heats restricted in dense wards unless bells warn neighbors. Sanctuary charters coordinate clinic windows with shift changes.

## Products (1500s typical)
Bar and plate; hoops and nails; tool blanks (adzes, chisels, springs); fittings for rigs, locks, cranes; simple shot and hoops for early guns; heavy ordnance remains bespoke and slow.

## Environmental Knobs
Charcoal seasons and forest caps; ash-yard runoff to be tiled; water-right disputes with dyers and paper-mills; flood-years shutter riverside sheds and shift smelting inland.

## Hooks (GM)
- A **roof fire** shutters a finery; a rival posts satyr-fines on the tower leg.  
- A **bad bar** breaks on a crane; Mixed Court day follows—was the proof stamp forged?  
- A **charcoal quota** bites mid-season; a debt clerk offers a quiet bond—strings attached.  
- A **night heat** runs during a green-rain; beadles pull the bell—panic or politics?
