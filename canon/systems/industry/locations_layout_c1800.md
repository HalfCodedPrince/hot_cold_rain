## Where it Sits
- **Heavy** (smelters, machinery, chemicals, shipyards): outer belts on **slightly higher ground**; near water for cooling & waste; on rail trunks.
- **Light** (textiles, electronics assembly): scattered in mixed districts; flexible labor in tenements and workshop rows.
- **Shipyard belts:** old slips repurposed; side-by-side with fish markets, scrap lanes, garbage transfer.

## Operating Reality
- **Reduced capacity**; “zombie factories” keep skeleton lines alive for lack of spares.
- **Pollution:** air & water chronic; green-rain years spike outfalls and fish bans.

## Work Texture
Whistles by the tide; backup generators bark; foremen trade **convoy slots** for spares.
