> **Definition.** A **Green Year** is any calendar year in which a city/route’s **Green Haze Index (GHI)** meets or exceeds the **Green Year threshold**. The designation may be **regional** (harbor belts, convoy legs) or **city-level**. It is a *risk label*, not a miracle claim.

## 1) The Green Haze Index (GHI)
GHI is scored per city (and per convoy leg) as a **weighted sum** of five observable families across the year:

1. **Sky/air tint days (GS-days).** Count of days with measurable daylight **green-shift** (Plate Bench color slides or beacon-aux cards pass the jade bar).  
2. **Water-bloom load (WB-score).** Sum of harbor/river **chlorophyll-bloom weeks** (jade test turns) and dredge reports of **biofouling** above normal.  
3. **Closures & burn orders (CB).** Hexads with **Blue Notices** (health closures) or **temple burn orders** for canal edges/deltas.  
4. **Clinic cases (CC).** Excess **spore-cough/plate-lung** admissions per 10k over baseline (seasonally adjusted).  
5. **Biota incidents (BI).** Reported **biofoul jams** (locks, intakes) and **stinging/bite swarms** tied to bloom days.

**GHI = (GS/10) + (WB/5) + (CB/3) + (CC/20) + (BI/10)**  
(Units chosen so a “bad” season naturally totals ≥12; tune locally.)

### Thresholds
- **Green Advisory:** any **two consecutive hexads** with GHI growth ≥2 (early warning).  
- **Green Year (city/route):** annual **GHI ≥ 12**, or **≥ 8** with at least **one continuous Advisory window** ≥ 5 hexads.  
- **Green Cluster (regional):** ≥ 3 connected cities/legs flagged Green Year.

> Notes: GHI correlates with wet heat, storm cycles, and rare orbital/solar stacks (see *mechanism*). It is **agnostic** to cause; it reads what the Plate, clinics, and works can observe.

## 2) Effects of a Green Year label

### 2.1 Insurance & premiums
- **Base surcharge** applied to flagged **convoy legs** (posted by insurers per route grade).  
- **Rebate (“Clean Lanes” seal)** available to cities whose sanctuaries and works meet **drill/kit** standards:
  - **Sanctuary Grade B or better**, **clinic kit** complete (masks, rinses, eye-wash, membrane oil).  
  - **Floodworks/locks** pass anti-biofoul drills.  
  - **Beacon-aux literacy** posted in roof-walks and steps (for mask days, closures).  
  Cities passing earn a % **premium reduction** on affected legs.

### 2.2 Convoy & port operations (minimum kit)
- **Mask days** posted; **filter baffles** required on intakes; **sealed-packet** hours enforced on lofts.  
- **Hull scraping windows** set by Plate/Temple; **drum bans** near crab yards on listed hexads.  
- **Festival schedules** reefed or shifted where GHI is rising.

### 2.3 Clinics & public health
- **Advisories** for **eye/air rinses**; brew limits on **Mire Lotus**; **no wet scraping** of **Gleam Lichen**.  
- **Switch counseling** notes: conception/early life during Green Year **raises variance** (see *mechanism*); midwives log Switch Hours.

## 3) Who declares what (governance)
- **Plate Bench (Beat II)** issues **Advisories** and **Green Year** labels from Plate/works/clinic reports;  
- **Temple** posts **burn orders** and ritual windows;  
- **Mixed Court** adjudicates fines for ignoring closures or “mark over kit” violations;  
- **Insurers/Guilds** publish route surcharges and available rebates.

## 4) FAQ (for editors)
- **Is a Green Year global?** No. It’s **per city/route**; clusters happen, but belts can stay normal while deltas run hot.  
- **Do Green Years increase greenborn?** **Slightly**, by exposure timing; clinics treat it as **risk of variance**, not fate.  
- **Does the label change with better drains?** Yes. **Floodworks** and **sanctuary drills** can push a marginal year back below threshold.

## 5) Hooks
- A convoy broker buys a **Green Advisory** rumor cheap and flips premiums.  
- A sanctuary fails its **kit audit** the day the Plate posts **mask days**; Mixed Court opens at dawn.  
- A printer’s sump sprat-hoppers jump the jade line; Plate slides over the **Green Year** threshold by one point.
