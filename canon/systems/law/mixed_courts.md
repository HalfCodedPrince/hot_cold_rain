## Scope & jurisdiction
Cross-rite **civil** benches for ward peace after the Day of Green Skies (1503). Jurisdiction covers: sanctuary warrants, festival/Access-Day timing conflicts, press & recension postings, **named torts** tied to line-kit and workspace safety, and co-type etiquette violations (ear-ports, wingsleeves, shrine rails).

## Composition (quorum)
- **3–5 seat quorum**, typically:
  - 1 city bench magistrate (civil)
  - 1 **procedure clerk** (Beat VI or civic equivalent)
  - 1 guild or works assessor (rotating)
  - (optional) 1 rite notary (Sea-Lotus, Rhythm house, etc.) when disputes cross rites
- Decisions recorded with **plate seals**; minority notes allowed as marginalia.

## Filing & procedure
- Petitions filed at ward houses; emergencies can be lodged from **sanctuary fronts**.
- Inspections may be ordered; results posted on beacon legs/guild doors with grade letters.
- **Fines-as-theatre** replace spectacle penalties; repeat neglect escalates to closures.

## Named torts (recognized definitions)
See the **Green Edicts** snapshot for canonical wording; Mixed Courts apply and scale penalties:
- **Membrane-pinch** — negligent/intentional damage to flight membranes/cuffs.
- **Smell-binding injury** — exposure (inks/chemicals) impairing olfactory function in copy/press rooms.
- **Cold-water negligence** — failure to provide baffles/dry cords/warm-up leading to hypothermia/injury.

## Calendars, festivals & Access Days
State calendars omit **Switch Hours**; Mixed Courts coordinate **Access Days** (clinics/inspections) with festival clocks so wards can function during green years. Retiming authority limited to ports and river hubs.

## Texts, plates & postings
**Beat II** recensions (and approved parallels in Free Cities) may carry side-notes/marginalia. Mixed Courts arbitrate posting rights and seize defamatory prints per ward code.

## Appeals & limits
Appeals go to the city’s high civil bench; criminal matters stay with regular courts. Mixed Courts cannot rule on doctrine—only **public peace, safety, and administration**.

## Era notes (1503–1560)
Riot rates fall as sanctuaries normalize drills and clinics; **“Deafening → Empty Chair”** becomes civic norm; Sea-Lotus ports adopt clinic integration early; pamphlet fights continue under clerk supervision.
