## Definition (what it is)
**Fines-as-theatre** is a Free-City style enforcement system where most civic infractions are handled as **public, ritualized fines**: posted in advance, read out by crier or Plate, receipted with a stamped token (the colloquial **satyr fine**), and logged to a ward ledger. The spectacle is the point: **visible predictability** substitutes for routine violence.

> Serious harms (assault, trafficking, fatal negligence, sect pogroms) **do not** qualify; they go to **Mixed Court**.

## Why cities use it
- **De-escalation:** channels crowd anger into a priced outcome (no martyr, no pogrom).
- **Insurance:** predictable penalties → lower route surcharges and better **clean lanes** rebates in Green Years.
- **Revenue-with-legitimacy:** better than bribes; the schedule is posted and appealable.
- **Behavior shaping:** it “marks the line” publicly (e.g., no drums near crab yards).

## How it works (the ritual)
1) **Rate Card posted** on ward noticeboards and Plate: what counts as an infraction, the base fine, and multipliers (festival, green-mask days, storm closures).
2) **Public issuance:** beadles (Sixth Whips) or Steps cite you; a bell/hand-drum mark accompanies readings on market days.
3) **Token & receipt:** pay or pledge; you get a stamped **satyr token** (wood/plate chit) or a docket slip; your name goes in the **Public Ledger**.
4) **Conversion ladder (optional):**
   - Pay fine → done; or
   - **Compliance swap** (buy/fit the required kit within a hexad: e.g., wingsleeves, vented crown) → fine reduced/waived; or
   - **Civic duty** (scrape shift, gutter-combing, floodgate watch) → fine converted.
5) **Appeal window:** narrow, to **Mixed Court** (procedural errors, discriminatory application, impossible compliance).
6) **Festival permits:** organizers can pre-post bonds to convert likely infractions into pre-paid fines (“pay to protest” without calling it that).

## Where it runs
- **Free Cities:** default street order tool; widely used.
- **Principality ports/corridor:** used, but under heavier **closure/hold** culture; Plate Bench sets tighter multipliers.
- **Interior sect towns:** rare; prefer bans, expulsions, or corporal punishments.

## What it is not
- Not a bribe (schedule is published; receipts are audited).
- Not absolution for serious crimes (those trigger arrest and Mixed Court).
- Not universal—hinterlands may reject it entirely.

## Common infractions (examples)
- **Drum zones near crab yards** (spooks pack/“drum crabs”): posted quiet rings; parade fines escalate by drum size.
- **Mask-day violations** during **Green Year** advisories: missing baffles/filters in shops; fine convertible to kit purchase.
- **Wet scraping of Gleam Lichen** (spore risk): scrape outside temple windows → satyr fine or clinic shift.
- **Wingsleeve/ear-port misconduct** (Bat/Fox etiquette): yanking seams/hoods → immediate fine; repeat → Mixed Court.
- **Burn-order breaches** (Spit Grass): unlicensed burn or missed window → fine + remediation duty.
- **Beacon ladder misuse** (aloft work zones): climbing during aux pattern → fine; tools confiscated.

## Editor knobs
- **Multipliers:** ×2 on festival days; ×3 during closures; ×½ for prompt compliance.
- **Visibility:** readout cadence (market day bell vs daily Plate slip) shifts how “theatrical” it feels.
- **Conversion rates:** % reduction for kit purchase vs hours of civic duty.
- **Insurance tie-in:** cities that keep conversion uptake high (more kit, fewer arrests) get better **clean lanes** rates.
- **Equity guard:** add a “three-waivers per hexad” rule for low-income wards to prevent predatory stacking.

## Notes on tone
Used well, fines-as-theatre is a **pressure release** and a way to make kit compliance normal. Used cynically, it’s **pay-to-breathe**. Both exist on the map.
