# Marriage & Vows (Ord–Sar)

## Marriage Pact (Beat-Six Form)
A civil-religious contract notarized by **Beat Six** and the city court. Key options:
- **Property regime:** separate / shared / trust.
- **Issue clause:** heirs named (including wards).
- **Cohabitation:** required / waived.
- **Consummation:** required / waived.

## Vow of the Long Breath (Beat-Two/Three Rite)
A public vow under the sun (Oboe) with choir witness. When paired with a **waived-consummation** marriage clause, it creates the familiar “Pulcherian” arrangement: **political marriage**, ritual vow of chastity.

## Effects in Practice
- Enables alliance without dynastic entanglement.
- Signals austerity & public piety; useful in crisis.
- If an heir is needed, the pact can name a **ward** (e.g., Nerise’s nephew) and bind succession support to him in the Council’s next election.

## Annulment & Breach
Breach of vow is a **religious scandal** (Beat Two); breach of pact is a **civil suit** (Beat Six). The two may proceed independently.
