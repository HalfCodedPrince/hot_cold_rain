## Marriage Pact (Beat-Six Form)
Civil-religious contract notarized by **Beat Six** and city court. Options: property regime; issue clause; cohabitation; consummation.

## Vow of the Long Breath (Beat-Two/Three Rite)
Public vow under Oboe with choir witness. When paired with waived-consummation, creates “Neresian” arrangement.

## Effects in Practice
Alliance without dynastic entanglement; piety signal; heir via ward clause.

## Annulment & Breach
Breach of vow = religious scandal (Beat Two); breach of pact = civil suit (Beat Six).
