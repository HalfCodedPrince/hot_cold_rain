## Outline
- **Rifted ancestors:** Ord and Sar split from a shared massif; the **Old Song basin** is a shallow, archipelago-rich sea over a broad ridge.
- **Island arcs:** Widiwidi arises on volcanic arcs; active margins seed fertile soils and hazard decades.
- **Sediments & fuels:** Ancient wetland deltas along Ordâ€“Sar coasts built organic-rich basins; coal/oil/gas occur in pockets; storms and silt complicate extraction.
- **Shock years:** volcanic ash decades perturb rain and light; remembered in rites and calendar notes.
