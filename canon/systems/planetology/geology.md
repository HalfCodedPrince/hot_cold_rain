# Geology & Plates
ID: GEO:TEK-001

## Macro-plates (sketch)
- ORD plate (north), SAR plate (south), WID plate (east/young, volcanic).
- Oceanic microplates along Ordâ€“Sar straits (island arcs).

## Orogeny
- Too-Kahet range: compressional uplift on ORD margin.
- Ord heartland uplands: older, eroded orogen with residual massifs.
- Widiwidi: active arcs, stratovolcano chains; ash cycles influence climate.

## Hazards
- Quakes near subduction zones; tsunamis periodic on east-facing coasts.
