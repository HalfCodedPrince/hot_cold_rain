ID: GEO:WAT-001

## Waters

## Green rain
- Cause: airborne pollen & photosynthetic micro-particulates seeded into storm systems; pigments shift rainfall tint.
- Health: generally nuisance-level; episodic toxic blooms from ‘spit grass’ (historic) and algal events.
- Management: gutters with traps; laundry/roof routines; temple advisories in ERA-700 calendars.

## Tides
