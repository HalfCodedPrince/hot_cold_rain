## Thesis
A base-6 legacy meets maritime finance: coin + warrants + insurance keep convoys moving; shocks show up first in **assurance prices** and **note rollovers**.

## Coinage & Notes (historical spine)
- **Ord liri** (bronze/silver) appear late Early Ord; weight-honest starts; sun-disc obverse; civic/High Master reverse.
- **Marr era debasements:** silver fraction drops; fiduciary tokens spread; **price edicts fail**; **warrants** temper shocks in major ports.

## Current units & media
- **Lira (₤)** standard across Longara/Ord sphere; **1 lira = 36 soldi = 216 deni**. 
- Coin baseline: bronze **deni**, nickel **soldi**, cupronickel **lira**; limited silver commemoratives (ERA-700). Notes: cotton/bast, intaglio + temple watermarks.
- Parallel scrip: **Temple Song-Notes** (festival/relief); **Port Warrants** (goods-backed, short term).

## Standards & shocks (modern era)
- Post-war fiat with soft peg to a **canal basket** (salt; diesel; rice-analog; copper). 
- Marine insurance often denominated in **Too-Kahet bank units**; exchange risk spikes in storm/ash years.

## Instruments (common)
Bills of lading; bottomry/respondentia; wharfage bonds; customs IOUs; **convoy insurance pools**. 

## Institutions
City mints; **Temple Notaries**; **Too-Kahet banks**; **Harbor Exchanges** post bid sheets for staples (rice, saltfish, rope, diesel).
