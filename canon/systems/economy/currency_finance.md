## Historical coinage notes (Ord–Sar era)
- **Ord liri** (bronze/silver) appear late ERA‑300, initially weight‑honest; images: sun-disc obverse, High Master or city seal reverse.
- Debasement cycles intensify under **Marr “the Skin Grass”** (late ERA‑700): reduced silver fraction; fiduciary tokens spread; price edicts fail.
- Parallel **warrants** continue (grain/port) and temper coin shocks in major ports.

## Currency
- **Lira (₤)** — standard unit across Longara and most Ord-aligned polities.
- Subunits: **1 lira = 36 soldi = 216 deni** (base‑6 legacy from Cuzhar Krum accounting).
- Coinage baseline:
  - **Bronze deni**, **nickel soldi**, **cupronickel lira**; limited silver commemoratives in ERA‑700.
  - Notes: cotton/bast blend; anti-forgery via intaglio + temple watermarks.
- Parallel scrip: **Temple Song-Notes** (festival/relief issuance), **Port Warrants** (goods-backed, short term).

## Standards & shocks
- Post‑war fiat with soft peg to a **canal-basket** (salt, diesel, rice analog, copper).
- Marine insurance denominated in **Too‑Kahet bank units**; exchange risk during storms/ash years.

## Instruments (common)
- Bills of lading; bottomry & respondentia loans (ship/cargo collateralized).
- Wharfage bonds; customs IOUs; convoy insurance pools.

## Institutions
- City mints; Temple Notaries (trust offices); Too‑Kahet private banks (highland vaults).
- Harbor Exchanges: daily bid sheets for rice, saltfish, rope, diesel.
