# Taxation & Finance — Ord–Sar (c.0–1200 AO)

## Scope & Thesis
A practical map of how rulers raise, move, and spend money from Pre-Ord through the Contract Port era. The center’s revenue mix shifts from **in-kind tolls and temple tithes** to **fees, fines, and charters**, but logistics (river lifts, beacon legs, convoy timetables) cap what’s collectible. Where paper outruns transport, **obedience becomes interpretation**.

## Core Revenue Instruments (evolution)

**c. BO–400 AO — In-kind levers**
- Temple tithes; levy service; road/ford tolls paid in grain, timber, ore.
- Tribute circuits with **account-tokens** (sticks, seals) and temple accounts.

**400–850 AO — Monetized tolls & offices**
- Wharfage, beacon fees, dredge assessments; customs at river mouths; convoy subscription tickets.
- **Office farms** begin: rights to collect a fee farmed to a house for a fixed rent.

**850–1050 AO — Ledgers, premiums, and scrip**
- Debt Office issues dredge & beacon paper; insurers post **Steps** (rate boards); convoy **tickets** become transferable.
- Fines standardized by statute and **bench-dockets**; temples keep parallel lists for vows/bonds.

**1050–1200 AO — Contract & drift**
- Treaty models narrow into city **charters**; mixed courts monetize procedure (fees to stamp, copy, and carry writs).
- Private war bleeds into escort business; subscription convoys bundle **insurance + pilots + watches**.

## Offices & Who Actually Touches the Money
- **Public Debt Office** — prices the future: rolls dredge/beacon notes, slices maturities into **bond stairs**; funnels rents from fee-farms.
- **Office of Imperial Works** — tenders dredge cycles, beacon oil, seawalls; purchases rope, pitch, iron under “Works lists.”
- **Harbor Watches** — collect approach fines, berth fees; sell “escort hours”; levy seizures under mixed writs.
- **Convoy Insurance Offices (“Steps”)** — set premiums; hold and delay claims; issue **whistle** leafs when rumor runs.
- **Grain Chancery** — weights/coins standards; validates ration rails (**grain notes**).
- **Council of Captains / Keeper of the Oboe Seal** — authorize fee schedules; stamp circulations; post circulars.
- **Courier Circuit & Assay Ring** — seals, timings, and assay slips that let paper/metal hop safely between benches.

## Collection → Treasury → Spend (flows)
- Quays/Pass Tolls & Fees → *(Watches clerks)* → port treasuries → Debt Office clearing.
- Temple tithes/levy commutations → *(Temple bursars)* → mixed courts → Works allotments.
- Convoy subscripts & premiums → *(Insurance Steps)* → claims reserve → escorts & beacons.
- Fines & bench-dockets → *(Court clerks)* → fee-farms rent → central stair servicing.

**Spend priorities (typical order):**  
1) debt service on beacons/dredge;  
2) convoy escorts/pilots;  
3) oil, rope, iron;  
4) festival arrears (stipends);  
5) inland posts.  
In failure years, debt service is paid in kind (oil/grain allotments) to keep beacons lit—coin follows when available.

## Records & Accounting Discipline
- **Day-books** at quays; **copy-trails** stamped by Keeper seals; festival closures reconcile.
- **Double-entry?** No formal debit/credit textbooks yet. Practice is **charge & discharge** by office: each clerk tracks **receipts** and **issues**; the Debt Office aggregates by stair & district. Composite ledgers appear late-Cadence in big ports handling insurance, debt, and fees together.
- **Audit & drift:** Claim-stairs (appeal ladders) slow payouts; “two seals” rule often broken under pressure.
- **Clerks** maintain charge & discharge books with festival tallies; any ‘balance’ is an audit narrative, not arithmetic equality.

## Failure Modes (c. 1050–1200)
- **Maintenance debt:** dredge/beacon paper rolled beyond service life; service slips when storms stack.
- **Cartel drag:** informals between Watches × Works × Insurers producing higher premiums and stalled claims.
- **Charter-creep:** Contract Port jurisprudence pushes power to city benches; center can post faster than it can enforce.

## Hooks for Other Pages
- **Procurement overlay (c.700–1200):** how tenders/fee-farms work and who skims.
- **Scrip & Tickets (forms):** convoy tickets, ration rails (grain notes), bench-dockets (diegetic scans).
- **Powder supply chain:** nitrate → foundry → convoy escorts.

## Quick Gloss
- **Bond stair:** staged maturities ladder.
- **Bench-docket:** court’s fines & fees schedule (printed leaf).
- **Grain note / ration rail:** redeemable food scrip within core wards.
- **Whistle leaf:** anonymous broadside accusing a Step or office.

## Appendix — Example Tender Cycle (beacon leg)
1) Works posts list (oil, wick, iron caps) →  
2) Debt Office sets cap by stair →  
3) Watch certifies access days →  
4) Insurers sign off to keep premiums flat →  
5) Keeper stamps →  
6) Pilots sign receipts →  
7) Auditor festival close.

### Complexity Dial (core → rim)
- **Core Wards (blue-lit ports):** full stack—bench-dockets, Steps, Works lists, Debt stair service, festival closings; convoy tickets widely accepted; grain notes redeemable in warrant warehouses.
- **Near-Coast Towns:** fee-farms and posted dockets present; insurance/claims handled by agents; convoy tickets often discounted; grain notes redeemable only on market days.
- **Interior & Passes:** tolls and in-kind commutations dominate; bench-dockets are copied by hand; convoy/claims paper mostly refused; relief runs operate by special mixed writs.
