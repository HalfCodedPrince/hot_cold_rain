Licensed brokers (“Factors”) convert captured goods into **Cleansed Goods Warrants (CGW)** for a commission (customary 4–7%). Lots are assigned to assay/warehouse by draw; split assay protects grades; licenses are bonded and posted each festival. Illiterate captains may sign by **thumb-mark warrant**. A simplified **Three-Scratch Docket** applies for small lots.
