## What they are
Licensed **pleasure bazaars** glued to Factors’ Row: ale, beds, cards, barbers, and a clerk who can write. The house carries a fat **bond**; fights and fences forfeit it.

## Why they exist
Crews off mangrove runs need a soft landing; benches need pirates steered into paperwork. Gardens do both.

## Mechanics
- **License & bond:** posted at door; renewal by festival.  
- **One-stop flow:** captains sign **thumb-mark warrants**; house factors run **Assay + Duty + Docket**; crew spends.  
- **Security:** courtyard plan with a single chokepoint; ward guards billet upstairs.  
- **Skims allowed:** queue jumps, exchange spreads, “table fees.”  
- **Red lines:** cleansing off the books; forged **Rate-Hold** kits; Access token fakery. All trigger **Mangrove Ordinance** or minting-fraud charges.

## Paper
- **Garden license plaque** shows bond amount and ward mark.  
- **House docket** lists factors’ commissions (customary 4–7%).  
- **Cleanliness Table** posts complaints/assay variances—public shaming keeps the skims thin.

## Culture
Actors and chorus houses rent stages in the same courtyard; half the era’s famous plays premiered “in the Gardens.”
