## What they are
Licensed **pleasure bazaars** glued to Factors’ Row: ale, beds, cards, barbers, and a clerk who can write. The house carries a fat **bond**; fights and fences forfeit it.

## Why they exist
Crews off mangrove runs need a soft landing; benches need pirates steered into paperwork. Gardens do both.

## Overview
- **Bundle:** ale, beds, cards, barbers, clerk.  
- **Placement:** doors on the Row; yard behind; one guarded choke.  
- **Purpose:** soften landfall for mangrove crews and funnel them into paperwork.

## Mechanics
- **License & bond:** posted at door; renewal by festival.  
- **One-stop flow:** captains sign **thumb-mark warrants**; house factors run **Assay + Duty + Docket**; crew spends.  
- **Security:** courtyard plan with single chokepoint; ward guards billet upstairs.  
- **Permitted skims:** queue jumps, exchange spreads, “table fees.”  
- **Red lines:** cleansing off the books; forged **Rate-Hold** kits; Access-token fakery. Triggers **Mangrove Ordinance** or minting-fraud.

## Institutions & Paper
- **License plaque:** shows bond amount and ward mark.  
- **House docket:** factor commissions customary **4–7%**; posted.  
- **Cleanliness Table:** complaints and assay variances posted to shame skims thin.  
- **Ward presence:** guards quartered over the gate; seizures hit the bond first.

## Interfaces
- **Factors’ Row:** the house clerk writes copy leaves; the Row’s factors close exchange and advance small credit against sealed bales.  
- **Fog-Gate Marts:** northern marts sometimes host a tame “Gardens lean-to.” Southern Gardens prepare convoy buys and receive re-exports sealed at the fog-gate (see linked marts page for threshold and custody logic).  
- **Proto-industry:** steady cash from convoy days keeps stages, kitchens, laundries, and repair yards running between runs.

## Culture
Actors and chorus houses rent the same yard. Many known plays premiere “in the Gardens.” Benches tolerate noise while the bond holds.
