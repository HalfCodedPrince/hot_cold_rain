## Thesis
**Fog-Gate Marts** are **seasonal, palisaded ports** on the Stern shore that “wake” when convoys touch the north rim. A single **gate across a tidal notch** is both a **customs sluice** and a **legal threshold**: pass the gate and your goods are under bench-law (Rhythm minimum); remain outside and you trade by **oath-stone** at your own risk. They are the seedbed of the later **Northern Cartels**.

---

## Season & Schedule
- **Windows:** two **festival weeks** per year tied to convoy windows; **rare “light-fog” years** open a short third window by posted order. Exact days ride the festival intercalaries; posted by courier leaf from the nearest Access node (often **Vitrana** or **Ord-Kahet**).
- **Daily bell:** three openings of the **fog-gate** per tide day (dawn, noon, dusk), each for ~one glass; foghorn patterns mark open/close.
- **Sleep mode:** outside windows the mart is shut; gate barred; oath-stone remains for local swaps only.

---

## Anatomy (standard layout)
- **A. Fog-Gate & Sluice:** timber-stone causeway with hinged barrier; sluice paddles drive a small **tidal mill** (grain/saws/stampers).
- **B. Watch Hut & Bell Rack:** foghorns (conch + bronze); **trumpet board** with challenge calls for covered convoys.
- **C. Oath-Stone (Market Pit):** carved basin on the outer side; oaths sworn **before** goods pass the gate; disputes dug here first.
- **D. Customs Tent (Bench Clerk):** weight stones, **scrip chest**, **copy leaf** press; stamps gate-**leaves**.
- **E. Assay Stall (Ring license):** simple beam scales + touchstone; **Assay Slip (ASL-N)** issues for metals, oil, high-value goods.
- **F. Exchange Shed:** benches + hooks; goods in **bond** while fees are tallied; no permanent warehouses at minor marts.
- **G. Fire-line & Quench:** sand, brine barrels; powder & spirits kept apart; smokes banned inside the palisade.
- **H. Palisade Market:** twenty to forty booths; **Crum oath-pit** in richer marts (clay bullae, debt readings at dusk).
- **I. Camp Strip:** lodges for shore crews, pack trains, and convoy factors; latrines downwind.

> Bigger marts add a **“Gardens lean-to”** (rum/bedhouse) under strict license; in most places it’s a dry, tame cousin of southern Gardens.

## Offices & Custody (who runs it)
- **Ward Bench (southern charter)** appoints a **market clerk** and two assistants; keeps the **gate-book** and toll **leaves**.
- **Assay Ring (itinerant)** holds a temporary license; split-assay 1:10 lots; stamps **ASL-N** (north form).
- **Shore Council (local)** provides **Peace-Men** (oath-keepers); sets **silence drums** and curfew.
- **Factors (temporary)** operate under **festival warrants**; any one factor can be booted by a two-seal complaint (bench + Peace-Men).

### Gate-book schema (fields the clerk records)
- **Day-mark** (stencil code) and **festival day**.
- **Oath code** (hand-stone witnesses, parties, locus).
- **Goods & measure** (reed/shell/cask; assay class if any).
- **Fees & tolls** posted, **assay slip** IDs, **duty** applied.
- **Bond flag** (in-bond vs released), **berth tally** half issued.
- **Dispute notch** if sent back to Oath-Stone; outcome code.

## How it actually works (two short paths)

### 1) Shore crew (upland/shore sellers)
1. **Oath first:** Meet buyer at the **Oath-Stone**; swear the trade (goods, measure, price, time) with two hand-stones on the basin lip.  
2. **Gate:** Clerk chalks the oath code on your sacks/casks; goods pass the fog-gate into bond.  
3. **Assay (if needed):** oil/metal/hide lots weighed or touched; **ASL-N** issued (tiny fee).  
4. **Copy & cash:** Clerk writes the **gate-leaf** (copy of the oath + fees); you get paid (shell, coin, rail) on the Exchange bench.  
5. **Disputes:** Same day, disputes lie **back** to the Oath-Stone; Peace-Men preside; if it fails, the clerk impounds goods until next tide.

### 2) Convoy factor (southern buyers)
1. **Notice:** Blow the trumpet challenge; if answered, you dock at the outer posts; Watch opens the gate.  
2. **List & bond:** File a **Need List (NL-N)** for hides/furs/oil/bast; lodge a coin/scrip bond.  
3. **Buy:** Match NL-N to oath lots; pay tolls & duty; take **gate-leaf** + **ASL-N** to cover re-export.  
4. **Seal:** Clerk paints the **day-mark** on bales; you clear the gate on the next horn.

## Fees & Duty (posted on a plank)
- **Gate Toll:** 1 in 40 value (2.5%) on everything passing inside (pays Watch & repairs).  
- **Assay Fee (optional goods):** oil/metals @ flat small fee per lot; hides @ weight bands.  
- **Exchange Cut:** 2% if you use the Exchange shed’s broker; 0% hand-to-hand (rare on convoy days).  
- **Shelter Fee:** copper per stall day during rain/fog layovers.
- **Sanctions:** **No cleansing duty** (this is not Morum); **no crab law**—fog marts use fines, seizure, and **exile**. Convoy/flag forgery is still minting-band felony if proven by southern clerks later.

---

## Law & Oaths (the threshold logic)
- **Outside the gate** you are under **oath-stone law** (local rite): hand-stones + witnesses bind.  
- **Inside the gate** you are under **Rhythm minimum**: gate-leaf + assay + tolls; appeals run to the charter bench **only during the festival**—after that, the mart sleeps.
- **Concordat of Three Gates (custom):** to host a fog mart, a shore council agrees to keep **calendar, oaths, and charity**. Doctrine stays private; timing and peace are public.

---

## Signals & Anti-Forgery
- **Foghorns:** open/close patterns posted daily; faking the horn earns **oath-ban** next season.  
- **Paint marks:** day-marks are **stencil-cut** shapes with a pepper-ash pigment; pigments change by courier packet; forgeries refused at the next Access node.
- **Split tallies (priority):** limited **berth tallies** mirror **Access Days**: a **ship half** lanyard and a **gate half** stick; mismatch = back of the line.

---

## Currency & Scrip
- **Shell & silver** dominate.  
- **Rail (grain notes):** promissory grain scrip redeemable at warrant warehouses and bonded granaries; **accepted by southern factors at a haircut** that widens with distance and late-season risk.  
- **Stone-vows** (Kllrian): oath-instruments recognized by Kllrian benches as collateral; not general tender; used for bulk lots and later settlement.

---

## Cartel seeds (how these marts grow into the Northern Cartels)
- **Shared signals:** horn patterns, stencil libraries, and pigment packets converge across marts, lowering fraud friction.  
- **Bench alignment:** festival warrants and two-seal complaints normalize expulsion rules for bad actors.  
- **Bond practice:** Exchange Sheds behave like a single bonded network during windows; clerks honor each other’s **ASL-N** and berth tallies.  
- **Rate discipline:** posted toll planks, common assay fees, and uniform haircuts on **rail** create cartel-like price floors at the rim.
