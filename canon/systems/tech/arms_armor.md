# Arms & Armor (Climate & Sea-Aware)
ID: TECH:ARM-000

## Environment constraints
- **Salt + Green Rain**: corrosion risk → tinned bronze, ferric phosphating, shell-lime waxes.
- **Flooded ground**: lighter kits; emphasis on slings, javelins, short thrusting spears.
- **Naval combat**: boarding over missile duels; nets and hooks crucial.

## Naval boarding kit (ERA-100 baseline)
- **ITEM:ARM-010 Boarding Axe** — short, bearded head; rope-cutter notch; rubberized cord wrap.
- **ITEM:ARM-012 Net & Hook** — weighted linen nets; bronze gaffs for rail control.
- **ITEM:ARM-014 Shell Tower Shield** — laminated crab-shell + cane; buoyant; rain-shedding.
- **ITEM:ARM-016 Sling, reef-stone** — braided bast sling; polished coral/stone shot.

## Land kit (city guard vs. levies)
- **Guards**: medium cuirass (lacquered cane + bronze plates), shield, short spear, side-hilt.
- **Levies**: shield + sling/javelin; rain-cloak; straw hat; bare legs for mud traction.

## ERA snapshots
- **ERA-100**: shell shields iconic; obsidian/flint inlands; bronze elite blades.
- **ERA-700**: iron tools common; tinned fittings; standardized spear heads; better varnishes.
- **GP era**: matchlock emergence (select provinces); pikes for floodplain defense.

## Signals
- Horns, drums, coded whistles; ship-to-ship flags limited by weather.

## Maintenance
- Rinse stations at docks; oil & lime-wax after action; temple workshops certify fittings.
