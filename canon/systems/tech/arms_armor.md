# Arms & Armor (Climate & Sea-Aware)
ID: TECH:ARM-000

## Environment constraints
- **Salt + Green Rain**: corrosion risk → tinned bronze, ferric phosphating, shell-lime waxes.
- **Flooded ground**: lighter kits; emphasis on slings, javelins, short thrusting spears.
- **Naval combat**: boarding over missile duels; nets and hooks crucial.

## Naval boarding kit (ERA-300/700 baseline)
- **ITEM:ARM-010 Boarding Axe** — short, bearded head; rope-cutter notch; lanyard; cord wrap.
- **ITEM:ARM-012 Net & Hook** — weighted linen nets; bronze/iron gaffs for rail control.
- **ITEM:ARM-014 Shell Tower Shield** — laminated crab-shell + cane; buoyant; rain-shedding.
- **ITEM:ARM-016 Sling, reef-stone** — braided bast sling; polished coral/stone shot.
- **ITEM:ARM-022 Reed-Hilt Hanger** — 55–65 cm single-edge cutter (seax/cutlass hybrid); salt-resistant scabbard.
