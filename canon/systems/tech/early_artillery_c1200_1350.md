## Families & forms
- **Pot-de-fer / tube guns** (early): wrought staves hooped; bolt/stone; crude beds; shocky recoil; good for **gate smashes** and **alley denial**.
- **Cast-bronze bombards** (mid): copper + tin (Ord uplands) cast muzzle-load; **stone shot** chiefly; set in timber beds or sledges; proofed with double charges.
- **Swivels** (deck/quay): iron or bronze; pintle mounts along rails; fire **case, langrage, small stone** to clear decks before boarding.

## Proof & marks (why guns stop exploding… as much)
- **Cold-shut & honeycomb** defects common early; foundries adopt **water-quench proofs** then live-fire proofs over sump pits.  
- Each piece stamped: **foundry mark**, **bore caliper notch**, **year bell**; failed guns **chiseled** and recast.  
- **Shot gauges** are wooden rings; **no full standardization**—stone is turned/trimmed to “fit the ring,” often wrapped in lime-cloth to seal.

## Foundry & supply (where this happens)
- **Slipway Quarter (Ord Bay)**: bronze bombards & swivels tied to convoy tenders; slag barged to river.  
- **Kahet uplands**: charcoal smelting & bellows craft; upland carts feed Bay with charcoal and copper.  
- **Kllrian temple works**: bulkhead castings + docile **junk-analog** swivels; famed for balanced pintles.

## Mountings & recoil
- **Beds & sledges** on land; wedged, not traversing.  
- Afloat: **breeching rope** and timber cheeks; castles carry two short bow pieces; stability margins forbid broadside batteries (our seas are ugly).

## Weather & safety
- **Gutter-pans** on touch holes; oiled covers on vents; match under clay cap in rain.  
- **No hot-shot** practice—too many wooden hulls; **firepots** still used by sling for incendiary work.

## Tactics & doctrine
- **Boarding first, gunnery second**: swivels and one or two short bombards **prepare** the rush.  
- **Quay fights**: stone and case at close range; target is men and masts, not walls—unless gate smashing.

## Failure modes (A gunner’s litany)
- “Rang wide”: bed slipped in wet mud; aim walked with pry-bars.  
- “Blew a bee-comb”: honeycombed casting burst at trunnion bed (pre-trunnion era pieces sit cradled; true **trunnions** emerge late in this window on rich commissions).  
- “Missed the castle”: fog + sleet + stone shot ovality; why **range boards** and **foundry marks** become fetish objects.

**Trajectory beyond 1350**  
- Trunnions regularize on high-status guns; iron balls begin to supplement stone where mills can true rounds; heavier hulls (see LGC-100 family) accept **a few** waist pieces, still far from line-of-battle doctrine.
