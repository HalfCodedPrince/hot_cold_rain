# Writing & Printing in the Humid Maritime Tropics

## Thesis
Humidity selects **bast, palm, and oil-cloth**; the temple’s **printed canon** and the guild **compositories** make literate ports. 

## Substrates
- **Bast paper** (mulberry/fig/breadfruit) sized with fish-glue/starch for books.  
- **Palm leaf** for liturgical/pilot leafs (incise + ink rub); **cloth leaf** for broadsides; **oiled barkcloth** for ritual placards. 

## Ink & plates
- **Carbon inks**; **iron-gall** for notes (kept away from salt air).  
- **Wood blocks** for text & staff; **copperplates** for charts & fine music; **movable type** in large houses for civic forms. 

## Book forms
- **Cord-bound leaf-books** (palm/bast) in temples and ports; **case-bound codices** for secular works; rolls rare. 

## Literacy & numeracy
- Coastal literacy is **wide but shallow** (broadsides, pilot marks, base-6 reckoning); choir literacy specialized. 

## Institutions / actors
- **Good Old Rhythm**: First printed recension ca. 705 AO; synod houses (esp. **Beat Two/Three**) standardize text, meter, and festival timing. 
- **Compository Houses** (guild): type/plates for civic forms, pilot-books, hymn leafs; license temple recensions and print secular works. 
## Practices
- Port editions with **lacquered edges**; **pilot-books** updated by convoy cycles; temple **lots/seals** on canonical text blocks (law sees them as standards).
