# Writing & Printing in the Humid Maritime Tropics

## Substrates
- **Bast paper (bark-paper):** from mulberry/fig/breadfruit bast; beaten, floated, and sun-cured; sized with fish-glue or starch; the main book paper.
- **Palm leaf:** for durable liturgical leafs and pilot-books; incised then ink-rubbed; cord-bound with lacquered boards.
- **Cloth leaf (“sailsheets”):** coarse, for broadsides and wall-posters; printed, then oil-waxed against rain.
- **Oiled barkcloth:** ritual placards; survives spray and green rain; heavy and costly.

## Ink & Plates
- **Carbon inks** (lampblack + fish-glue/starch), optionally with seaweed mucilage for flow.
- **Iron-gall variants** used for annotations, but avoided near salt air (corrosion).
- **Wood-press blocks** for text & simple staff-lines; **copperplates** for charts and fine music; **movable type** exists in larger compositories for fixed civic forms.

## Book Forms
- **Cord-bound leaf-books** (palm/bast) for temple/port use.
- **Case-bound codices** (bast paper) for secular works; lacquered edges in port editions.
- **Rolls** uncommon (mildew).

## Literacy & Numeracy
- Coastal urban literacy is **wide but shallow**: many can sound out broadsides, read pilot-marks, and handle **sextal** counting for tariffs, measures, and tides.  
- **Choir literacy** (notes, hand-sign, meter) is specialized; sailors learn **marks & numbers** more than long prose.
