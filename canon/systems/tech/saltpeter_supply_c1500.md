## Thesis
Gunpowder is already practical in sieges and watches, but the **rate-limiter is saltpeter**. The Principality meets demand by formalizing **urban nitraries** (soiled earth + manures + urine tithes), leaching houses, and river-side boil sheds—tied together by **convoy seasons, Access Days, and inspection postings** rather than a single monopoly.

## Sources & Inputs
- **Nitrary earth:** stable floors, midden yards, latrine soils, rubble under drying sheds; temple “urine dues” and public house barrels.
- **Additions:** lime dust, old mortar scrap, straw chaff; **potash lye** from ash yards to drive nitrate conversion/precipitation.
- **Green belts:** humid littoral & delta wards yield best (more organic waste + warm roofs). Clinics and ward beadles post rinse/cover rules on **green-rain** weeks to cut nuisance. 

## Process Flow (shop rubric)
1) **Compost & dry** (months to years): alternated layers of earth/manure/ash under rain-covers; turn, sprinkle, keep warm/dry.  
2) **Leach:** draw lyes through beds; strain to vats.  
3) **Clarify & fix:** settle, add potash; boil down; scrape crystals; re-dissolve and re-boil for higher grade.  
4) **Dry & grade:** coarse “serpentine” crystals for bulk, finer for corning houses.  
5) **Bag & seal:** jute or waxed paper; plate-sealed tallies for inter-mart shipment.

## Grades & Use
- **Bulk serpentine:** for mines/signal pots; cheap but inconsistent.  
- **Refined (re-boiled):** watches & siege trains.  
- **Corned (rich ports):** limited, higher energy and flow; favored by elite trains.

## Sites & Seasonality
- **Urban nitraries** in warm/dry wards;  
- **Leach/boil sheds** on rivers for water/fuel;  
- **Port corning houses** in wealthy marts (quality paper, better controls).  
Output dips in long wet spells; rises after festival seasons (more “feedstock”).

## Governance, Law & Risk
- **Mixed Courts** arbitrate stink/contamination complaints, seized sacks, and assay disputes; **fines-as-theatre** preferred in Free Cities over marks/brands.  
- **Green Edicts** align **Access Days** so clinic/inspection windows don’t stall convoys; posts require **plate seals** and ward grades; riots drop as schedules settle.  
- **Bench finance:** Debt Office float for sheds, barges, and yard walls; Works maintain locks/dredge cycles so nitrate moves.

## Logistics & Prices (rule-of-thumb)
- **Up-price:** saltpeter itself, clean potash, good paper sacks.  
- **Friction:** river chokepoints (locks/bars), festival mis-timings, pamphlet seizures in hot cities.  
- **Signals:** beacon-leg aux patterns for closures; packets carry assay slips; convoys cluster in dry months.

## Nuisance & Public Health
Stink, brine spills, flybeds. Ward codes require covers, drains, and **quiet clinic lanes** nearby; beadles can shutter yards that ignore rinse/roof rules during green weeks.

## Hooks (GM)
- A seized lot lacks a **plate-sealed assay**; court day or bribe?  
- A wet year rots nitraries; a port floods the market with **corned** imports.  
- A printers’ lampoon brands a nitrary “plague yard”; Free City censors shrug; insurers don’t.  
- Access Day collides with festival → convoy stalls → soldiers go without powder.
