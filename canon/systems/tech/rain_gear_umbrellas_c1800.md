## Everyday Layers
- **Loose tunics & wraps** over shorts or trousers; cinch cuffs for wind.
- **Capes/ponchos:** waxed cloth, oiled canvas, fish-skin analogues; arm slits; tie-downs for gusts.
- **Headgear:** reinforced wide brims; close hoods for squalls.
- **Masks/scarves:** habitual in pollen surges; dyed patterns as house or choir marks.
- **Footing:** rubber boots for muck; sandals for fair days.

## Green-Rain Protection
- **Translucent cloaks** (jade-tinted) and **rain aprons** for vendors/porters; quick-rinse basins at market gates.

## Umbrellas & Kin
- **Umbrellas:** short-handled, wide; split bamboo ribs with canvas or thick paper; netting reinforcement.
- **Storm parasols:** vented double canopy; poor wards use framed fabric **storm shields**.
- **Portable awnings:** bamboo poles + tarps; queue/lane shade on market streets.
