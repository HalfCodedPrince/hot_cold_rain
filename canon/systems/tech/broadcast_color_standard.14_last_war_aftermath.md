# Broadcast Color Standard — ERA-14 “Cadence Color”

## What changes from base
Post-war authorities adopt **one goodwill project**: a color TV spec backward-compatible with black-and-white sets. Budget graft, supply shortages, and one doomed “peace-probe” leave only **a few years of color fervor** — but the images are iconic.

### Technical spine (plain-language)
- **Compatibility first:** Color is added as a **sub-carrier** riding the old monochrome signal; B/W sets ignore it, color sets decode it.  
- **Hue stability in bad weather:** A short **reference burst** on each line lets coastal sets correct hue drift after rain-fade/multipath.  
- **No exotic tubes required:** Early color receivers use **add-on decoder boxes** (guild repairable) and triad-mask CRTs; inland workshops can re-gun B/W tubes or fit **field-sequential wheels** for stopgap color.  
- **Audio unchanged;** captions standardized by Compositories (port schedules, advisories).

### Effects
- **Civic morale:** live color coverage of harbor rites and choir festivals becomes the “new hope” of ERA-14.  
- **Economic trace:** temple & port boards print **color test cards**; **licensing** for color transmitters becomes a small municipal revenue stream.  
- **Fragility:** rain-fade ghosts and ash-year scatter produce **greenish fringes**; color broadcasts are the first to be throttled during fuel squeezes.

### Hooks
- A cathedral-green broadcast becomes a relic everyone remembers; rumors swirl that a final tape from the lost probe once aired in color — for minutes.
