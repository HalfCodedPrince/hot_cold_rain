## Early trickle (c.1100–1180)
- **Temple apothecaries** play with saltpetre for **signal pots** and fireworks; humidity is the enemy; recipes travel by hymn-margin notes.
- **Beat Six** issues first **saltpetre house** licenses (latrine/compost scrapes) under nuisance law.

## Scale-up & corning (c.1180–1230)
- Port compositories print **powder tables** and **boil orders**; kernels are **corned** and glazed for steadier burn (see baseline page).  
- Mangrove/shorewood banned for naval charcoal; upland willow-analogue becomes “powder wood.”

## Mills & marks (c.1210–1280)
- **Horse-driven stamp mills** appear on the Salt River; hazard rules: lightning rods, no iron nails near the millhouse, veils down.  
- Casks stamped by ward (**bell-mark + year**) and by **saltpetre license number**; counterfeit marks punished by Watch courts.

## Procurement & politics (c.1250–1350)
- **Blue-paper powder**: emergency purchases posted at the Steps during **Broken Chain** weeks.  
- **Marque quotas**: private boats must carry a set weight of “ward powder” to renew pennant; smuggling endemic.  
- Inland fairs trade **meal-tickets for powder**; famine years push illegal nitre-scrapes.

## Failure lore
- “Sweating casks” in green-rain seasons; **gutter-pan** and hide cases become standard.  
- Fires at mills → **bell-laws** mandate water troughs, sand barrels, and a **no-song hour** during ramming.

**Trajectory after 1300**  
- Better corning + screened charcoal → higher muzzle energies; printed **range boards** spread; powder becomes a tax base for ports with mills.
