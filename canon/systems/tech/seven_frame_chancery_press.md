## What it is
A clamp-lever **forms press** with seven interchangeable frames sized to docket sheets, writs, and coupons. It turns clerk-copied leafs into fast, plate-set forms. Not the first **printing** (leafs & copperplates existed), but the first **high-throughput office press** born from collapse-era paperwork.

## When & why
**c. 1047 AO, Ord City (Grain Chancery annex).** Docket floods made hand copy untenable; a clerk team and a plate-setter from Compository Row bolted a lever carriage atop a grain scale frame.

## How it works
- **Seven frames** (writ, coupon, docket, ledger slip, seal strip, notice, summons).  
- **Removable plate-beds** take copper or hardwood plates; inking rollers improvised from oiled reed.  
- **Foot-treadle in later versions**; first units were arm-lever only.

## What changed
- **Throughput**: 10–15× a clerk’s fair copy for forms.  
- **Standardization**: seals and blanks aligned across offices.  
- **Diffusion**: guilds adopted the design and sold it as the “**Seven**” to ports.

**Matters later:** makes almanacs, rate boards, and pass ledgers cheap; fuels both bureaucracy and pamphlet wars.
