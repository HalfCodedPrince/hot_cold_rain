## Supply & chemistry
- **Saltpetre houses** (latrines + compost pits) licensed by Beat Six; nitre scraped, leached, and **corned** by 1210–1230 AO.  
- **Charcoal discipline:** mangrove/shorewood banned for naval grades; upland willow-analogue preferred.  
- **Sulfur** from arc vents/ore works; temple auditors count cask weights.

## Weather problem → workarounds
- Powder kept in **oiled hide cases**; horn chargers wax-sealed; match carried under clay caps.  
- **Gutter-pans** on guns shed rain; crews drill with veil/hood up.

## Weapons (land & deck)
- **Hand slings + firepots** persist early; by 1220+ appear **match arquebuses** (short iron barrels, forked rest). Practical in alleys, gallery fights, and fort gates; **slow in squalls**.  
- **Swivel guns** (3–6-lb stone/iron) on quay towers and escort luggers; anti-personnel case dominates.  
- **Bombard carts** for siege stings (masonry cracking, gate smashing); never field-mobile in mud seasons.

## Doctrine
- Arquebus ranks set **behind shell shields**; volley on bell, then retreat to sling/axe.  
- At sea: swivels clear decks for boarding; **no broadside doctrine** yet — hulls too light, weather too foul.

## Safety
- **Lightning rods** mandated on magazines; no open flame within two spear lengths; fines to ward kitchens.

**Trajectory beyond 1300 AO (signpost, not mandate):** move from match to **slow-wheel/serpentine hybrids** in rich wards; corning quality lifts muzzle energy; heavier sea pieces demand stronger hulls (see Ocean-Ranging Hulls).
