## What Holds Up
- **Asphalt:** possible but fragile—rutting, potholes, washouts without constant repair.
- **Stone/cobble:** old high districts; costly but flood-tolerant.
- **Concrete:** durable if funded; cracks on quake/landslide lines.
- **Unpaved:** packed earth in low-value wards; turns to soup after rain.
- **Raised boards/causeways:** foot traffic over market belts and flood alleys; rebuilt every few years.

## City Soundtrack
Boots on boards, tires slapping puddles, carts banging loose stones; flood marks painted on the first-floor walls.
