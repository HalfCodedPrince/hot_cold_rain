## Fleet Character
- **Rugged boxes:** high clearance, wide tires, snorkeled intakes; canvas awnings; external filters.
- **Engines:** diesel first; some bioethanol; carburetors favored over finicky injectors.

## Street Structure
- **Primary embankments** carry buses and carts; some alleys double as **boat channels** in flood.
- **Sponge works:** bioswales, rain gardens, permeable alleys slow runoff (where funded).

## Use Patterns
- **Seasonal switches:** ferries/cable lines displace trucks in typhoon weeks.
- **Intermodal ramps:** bus → ferry platforms at cable hubs; handcart last-mile into covered markets.

> _Tag on a depot board:_ “Two tides late = boat it.”
