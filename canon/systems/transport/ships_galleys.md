## Types
- **City Galley (CG-24/36):** 24–36 oars (single bank), lateen/sprit aux; crew 80–120 (rowers, marines, officers).
- **Escort Cutter (EC-12):** 12 oars; fast picket/dispatch; crew 30–40.
- **Grain Barge (GB-0):** towed/sail-assisted; shallow draft; standardized beam for locks.

## Propulsion & Speed
- Trained professional oarsmen (paid, drilled) reach 6–7 knots sustained; 8–9 knots burst (~10–15 min). Untrained crews underperform by ~30–40%.
- Lateen/sprit sails add 1–2 knots off the wind; not primary in close quarters.

## Crewing
- **Rowers:** paid professionals (ERA-02 reform attempt); otherwise mixed freemen/obligate service in ERA‑300.
- **Marines:** 20–40 per city galley; kit weight kept low (see below).
- **Boat-handlers:** cox, bosun, signaler, carpenter, cook, surgeon’s mate.

## Boarder Kit (weight discipline)
- Shell tower shield (~4.5–5.5 kg), thrusting spear (~1.6 kg) *or* boarding axe (~1.2 kg), sling & pouch (~0.3 kg), dagger (~0.3 kg), hanger optional (~0.9 kg). Wet cloak off during action.
- Max carried in action: **~8–10 kg**; swimmers drop shield & spear if overboard; axes/hangers are retained via lanyards.

## Tactics
- Approach under oar; silence horns until last minute; nets + hooks to foul rails; marines surge in squads by captain.
- Night anchor raids; cutting cables; fendered prow impacts.

## Build & Maintenance
- Reed-keel with timber ribs; cane stringers; sacrificial bow fenders.
- Tinned iron fittings where needed; lime-wax on exposed metal; fresh-water rinse after sorties.
