## Why the shift
- **Broken Chain** beacons + longer convoy hops push beyond Bright Sea lanes.  
- Gray fleets, temple missions, and contract ports need hulls that **live outside** the legs.

## Build changes
- From reed-keel/cane stringers → **laminated timber keels**, **carvel-like planking**; frames pegged and treenailed.  
- **Sheer & freeboard** increased for green seas; **watertight bulkheads** appear on Kllrian designs.  
- **Leeboards & twin rudders** on shoal cruisers; sacrificial forefoot for reef kisses.

## Rig families
- **Bright Sea Caravel (BSC-40/60):** twin lateen/sprit; shallow draft + leeboards; crew 12–22; ideal for survey/mission runs.  
- **Longara Carrack (LGC-80/100):** high forecastle/aftercastle; mixed square + lateen mizzen; cargo and gun platform (swivels along rails).  
- **Kllrian Junk-analog (KTA-70):** battened panels, balanced rudder, bulkheads; docile in squalls, superb station-keeping.

## Armament (typical)
- 6–12 **swivels** per 80-100-tonner; a pair of short **bow bombards** on strongest builds; handgunners atop castles.  
- No continuous broadside yet; stability margins too tight in our seas.

## Convoy use
- **Escort luggers** screen ahead; caravels scout bars; carrack leads with signal mast & horn code; barges ride center.  
- In **Broken Chain** weeks: night-running under reefed tops; pilots swap **errata leafs** at dawn.

## Maintenance
- Copper sheathing rare/experimental; lime-wax and scrubbing stages remain standard.  
- Slipways sized for BSC-60/LGC-80; 100-tonners require the few deep cradles left from the Cadence.
