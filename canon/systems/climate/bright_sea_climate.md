# Climate of the Bright Sea

## The Old Song (basin gyre)
- **Pattern:** A monsoon-like **seasonal gyre**: northbound along Sar in the dry, south/eastbound along Ord in the wet.  
- **Beats:** Short-Beat windows (safe); Long-Beat anomalies (rare, high risk).  
- **By 950 AO:** Beacon/watches make night entries routine; **variance rising** (multi-decadal), nudging bars to silt.

**Matters later:** slight phase shifts + seawall success = **sediment misplacement** → dredge debt.

## Green Rains
- **Nature:** wind-driven green algal aerosols + rain tint, strongest at bright-sea turnarounds; sticky films rot cordage and grain.  
- **Seasonality:** peaks when Old Song flips; strongest on windward reef belts.  
- **Mitigation:** oiled cloths, resin caulk, raised granaries, fog-bell cleaning cycles.

**Trend by 950:** frequency stable, **intensity up** on western Ord and Sar river mouths (due to runoff + seawalls).  
**Matters later:** storage spoilage spikes; reed-camp disease seasons worsen.

## Storms & Lanes
- **Headland vortices** predictable; **emerald squalls** (green-tinted downpours) mark shear lines.  
- **Capes** amplify hazard when dredge cycles slip; watch bells carry farther in wet air.

## Inland bands
- **North-Ord uplands:** cool, gusty; pass snow in Long-Beat extremes.  
- **Sar interior:** wet-hot with break-monsoon drought pockets; fever corridors along reed belts.  
- **Kllrian arcs:** orographic uplift → terrace-friendly rain; volcanic ash years boost yields.

## Multi-decadal variance (Cadence era)
- Subtle **30–40y swings** in Old Song strength; coincident with reef growth pulses.  
- Correlated **premium cycles** (insurance tables quietly adjust).  
**Matters later:** a bad swing near 1045–1055 sets the table for the **Quiet Panic**.
