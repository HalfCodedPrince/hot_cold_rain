## Thesis
Sar’s rite shares the Rhythm’s civic beat but centers **form and cleansing** over discipline: geometry, water, and antiphonal song. It is the Rhythm a harbor architect would design.

## Hallmarks
- **Temples**: colonnades around stepped tanks; roof lanterns; line-of-sight to beacons.
- **Music**: **antiphonal choirs**, foot-bells, clapped meters; less drone, more lattice.
- **Ritual**: **lustrations** (baths) before contracts, marriage, and festivals; ink-wash diagrams of tides during sermons.
- **Law**: benches sing **procedure**, but penalties emphasize **restitution + lustral bonds**; **deafening** rejected as barbaric.
- **Text**: own **Sea Recension** plates; cross-licensed with Ord but with marginal glosses (geometry over moral maxims).

## Frictions & Fits
- **With Ord**: agrees on calendars; disputes Beat VI scope; trades choirs with Ord collegia.  
- **With Knees**: shares some dance; refuses vision-leaves as scripture.  
- **With Kllrian**: accepts terrace vows as valid marriage seals after lustration.
