## Thesis
City-states on the western rim remember **Kuzhar Crum**â€”the under-treasury of the dead. They run **market temples** where oaths, ledgers, satire, and small gods share a roof with Rhythm meters.

## Hallmarks
- **Temples as exchanges**: oath-pits; clay **bullae**; oath-burials to close deals; public reading of debt cancellations at festivals.  
- **Priest-merchants**: deacons who tally & mock; **satyr plays** lampoon corrupt benches and priests (audiences bring fish).  
- **Pantheon**: small gods of **locks, bridges, chimneys, ledgers**; Oboe acknowledged as the **clock**, not the king.

## Law & Peace
- **Fines not brands**; **banquets not deafening**; satire is a legal release valve.  
- **Calendars**: adopt convoy weeks; keep two **Crum nights** for ledger rites; benches accept both.

## Frictions & Fits
- **With Ord**: happy to print and pay; loathe ritual cruelty; fuel the pamphlet trade.  
- **With Sar**: swap geometry and oath-forms; polite competition in festivals.  
- **With Knees/Kllrian**: pragmatic; everyone is welcome if the oath holds.
