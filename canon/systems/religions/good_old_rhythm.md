# Good Old Rhythm (Old Bold Rhythm)
- **Core**: Sun (Oboe) as conductor; daily votive music.
- **Zambran reforms**: Tenets compiled/printed; temple-conservatories built.
- **Ritual media**: Woodwinds, shell horns; funeral use of (defanged) spit grass.
- **Schisms**: Conservatory orthodoxy vs 'Splendid Word' syncretists.

## The First Canon (Old Bold Rhythm) — Editorial Circle

**Dates:** c. 696–705 AO (compilation), first printed recension c. 705 AO  
**Convenor:** Eshoron Ir (then High-Master-in-waiting; chaired deliberations)  
**Patron & Enforcer:** High Master **Zambran** (funded presses, mandated circulation to port-temples and courts)

**Principal Redactors (Sar-trained):**
- **Nasha of Tau-Hi** — natural philosopher & mariner-tutor. Provided commentaries on winds, rains, and seasonal lanes used to time public rites.
- **Kelim Ar of Sar-North** — musicologist & grammarian. Authored *The Six Beats*, standardizing meter, hand-sign, and call-and-response for mass performance.
- **Teyu the Grey** — former tutor-slave turned steward. Wrote administrative notes on camp discipline, supply, and ore logistics later adapted for temple choirs and civic rites.

> Scholarly consensus treats Zambran’s “authorship” as mythic shorthand for patronage: the circle wrote, **Zambran made it law**.

## Synod of Beats (Hierarchy & Governance)
**Houses (IDs):** First `FAC:BEAT-001` · Second `FAC:BEAT-002` · Third `FAC:BEAT-003` · Fourth `FAC:BEAT-004` · Fifth `FAC:BEAT-005` · Sixth `FAC:BEAT-006`  
**Synod:** `FAC:SYN-001` (umbrella council)
**Printers’ guild:** `FAC:COMP-001`
The Rhythm’s higher governance crystallized into a **six-house synod** (mirroring the sextal civic cadence):

1. **House of the First Beat** — doctrine & cosmology; defines orthodoxy, handles heresy cases.
2. **House of the Second Beat** — **text & music**; edits recensions, notates modes, trains master scribes/choirmasters.
3. **House of the Third Beat** — ritual & calendar; harmonizes festival timing with tideways and seasonal lanes.
4. **House of the Fourth Beat** — missions & harbors; liaises with the Council of Captains and port magistracies.
5. **House of the Fifth Beat** — charity & public health; soup kitchens, infirmaries, flood relief.
6. **House of the Sixth Beat** — discipline & courts; internal discipline, arbitration, and docketing with civic courts.

Temple colleges (“choirs-colleges”) sit under Beats Two and Three and double as **scriptoria** and **conservatories**.

## Compository Houses (Commercial Guilds)

Outside the temples, **Compository Houses** are guild-chartered printer-editors that:
- set **type and plates** for civic forms, pilot-books, broadsides, hymn-leafs;
- employ **compositors** (text) and **arrangers** (music);  
- license **temple-approved recensions** and publish secular works.

A temple seal on a leaf guarantees **canonical text & mode**; unsealed print may circulate freely but lacks liturgical standing. In practice, compositories and the House of the Second Beat maintain a tense, profitable partnership.
