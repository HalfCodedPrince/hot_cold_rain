- **Core**: Sun (Oboe) as conductor; daily votive music.
- **Zambran reforms**: Tenets compiled/printed; temple-conservatories built.
- **Ritual media**: Woodwinds, shell horns; funeral use of (defanged) spit grass.
- **Schisms**: Conservatory orthodoxy vs 'Splendid Word' syncretists.

## The First Canon (Old Bold Rhythm) — Editorial Circle

**Dates:** c. 696–705 AO (compilation), first printed recension c. 705 AO  
**Convenor:** Eshoron Ir (then High-Master-in-waiting; chaired deliberations)  
**Patron & Enforcer:** High Master **Zambran** (funded presses, mandated circulation to port-temples and courts)

**Principal Redactors (Sar-trained):**
- **Nasha of Tau-Hi** — natural philosopher & mariner-tutor. Provided commentaries on winds, rains, and seasonal lanes used to time public rites.
- **Kelim Ar of Sar-North** — musicologist & grammarian. Authored *The Six Beats*, standardizing meter, hand-sign, and call-and-response for mass performance.
- **Teyu the Grey** — former tutor-slave turned steward. Wrote administrative notes on camp discipline, supply, and ore logistics later adapted for temple choirs and civic rites.

> Scholarly consensus treats Zambran’s “authorship” as mythic shorthand for patronage: the circle wrote, **Zambran made it law**.

## Synod of Beats (Hierarchy & Governance)
**Houses (IDs):** First `FAC:BEAT-001` · Second `FAC:BEAT-002` · Third `FAC:BEAT-003` · Fourth `FAC:BEAT-004` · Fifth `FAC:BEAT-005` · Sixth `FAC:BEAT-006`  
**Synod:** `FAC:SYN-001` (umbrella council)
**Printers’ guild:** `FAC:COMP-001`
The Rhythm’s higher governance crystallized into a **six-house synod** (mirroring the sextal civic cadence):

1. **House of the First Beat** — doctrine & cosmology; defines orthodoxy, handles heresy cases.
2. **House of the Second Beat** — **text & music**; edits recensions, notates modes, trains master scribes/choirmasters.
3. **House of the Third Beat** — ritual & calendar; harmonizes festival timing with tideways and seasonal lanes.
4. **House of the Fourth Beat** — missions & harbors; liaises with the Council of Captains and port magistracies.
5. **House of the Fifth Beat** — charity & public health; soup kitchens, infirmaries, flood relief.
6. **House of the Sixth Beat** — discipline & courts; internal discipline, arbitration, and docketing with civic courts.

Temple colleges (“choirs-colleges”) sit under Beats Two and Three and double as **scriptoria** and **conservatories**.

## Compository Houses (Commercial Guilds)

Outside the temples, **Compository Houses** are guild-chartered printer-editors that:
- set **type and plates** for civic forms, pilot-books, broadsides, hymn-leafs;
- employ **compositors** (text) and **arrangers** (music);  
- license **temple-approved recensions** and publish secular works.

A temple seal on a leaf guarantees **canonical text & mode**; unsealed print may circulate freely but lacks liturgical standing. In practice, compositories and the House of the Second Beat maintain a tense, profitable partnership.

## Basic Tenets (Old Bold → “Good Old”)
1) **Keep the Beat:** Conform your work and speech to the civic **cadence** (festival days, toll windows, convoy cycles). Harmony = public peace.  
2) **Roles before Souls:** Virtue is **right conduct in your station**—pilot, porter, priest, parent. Intention is secondary; predictability is sacred.  
3) **The Oboe Conducts:** The **Sun (Oboe)** orders seasons and tides; rites follow **natural timings** (winds, rains, lee chains).  
4) **Six-House Order:** Doctrine (I), **Text & Music** (II), Calendar (III), Missions/Harbors (IV), Charity/Health (V), **Discipline/Courts** (VI). Each house has a job; don’t sing another’s part.  
5) **Song is Law’s Skin:** Law should be **memorizable** and **singable**. What cannot be sung cannot be enforced safely.  
6) **Public Peace as Mercy:** The poor are kept by **Beat Five**; the wild by **Beat Six**. Charity and discipline are complementary, not opposed.

> In orthodox teaching the “soul” is a citizen’s **capacity to keep time**—privately devout or skeptical, publicly on beat.

## Basic Realities (what people actually do)
- **Daily votive singing** at ward shrines; choirs-colleges teach **hand-sign** and call-and-response meters (Kelim Ar’s *Six Beats*).  
- **Calendar = logistics:** tideways and convoy seasons set festivals; port weeks flex by harbor packets (yes, the Rhythm really does move with ships).  
- **Temples as conservatories:** music schools, **scriptoria**, bursaries for bright poor; funerals with woodwinds/shell horns; **defanged spit-grass** only for mourning.  
- **Benches + Synod:** public edicts co-signed; composition houses set official **recensions** with Beat Two, then sell secular print on the side; a tense but lucrative partnership.  
- **Courts sing procedure:** Beat Six clerks drill **metered formulas** for oaths, fines, and warrants; “law as chant” keeps mixed juries from getting lost.

## Why elites dislike it (clerics & compositories)
- **Gatekeeping at Beat Two:** monopoly on **text & mode**; licensing throttles rivals; secular printers resent **temple seals** and “approved plates.”  
- **Ossification:** editorial committees defend cadence purity while practice changes; **pamphleteers** call it museum-law.  
- **Censorship drift:** doctrine rides on metrical rules; “wrong meter” becomes grounds to **suppress** (cheap way to censor arguments).  
- **Power creep to Beat Six:** discipline spills into civic courts; **deafening** as heresy theater horrifies even loyalists.  
- **Economy of ritual:** festivals cost money; benches co-opt rites for tax amnesties and loan renewals—priests feel like **accounting skin**.

## Why common folk dislike it (and still show up)
- **Time taxes:** mandated ceremonies cut work hours in tight seasons; fines for missing the **Third Beat** sting day laborers.  
- **Noise police:** ward beadles confiscate drums/fifes outside approved modes; weddings and totémic dances get “metered” or fined.  
- **Price of mercy:** soup lines (Beat Five) come with sermons; some see charity as a tool to shame the poor.  
- **Ritual over rain:** inland farmers grumble when the port-set calendar **misaligns** with hill rains.  
- **Syncretic squeeze:** ancestral/totem rites get folded under “**Splendid Word**” labels or pushed to night margins; some love the blend, many feel trimmed.

## Fault-lines feeding the Pamphlet Wars
- **Conservatory vs “Splendid Word”** (orthodox musical text vs syncretic preachments).  
- **Who owns the text?** Beat Two plates vs **compository editions**.  
- **Deafening & Discipline:** cruelty and scope of Beat Six; should law sing or deliberate?  
- **Cadence drift:** ports vs uplands over calendars; does the Oboe conduct farmers or pilots?  
- **Kin-Maze & Nepotism:** Elector marriages tug Synod seats and bursaries; “the Chorus of Cousins.”

## Aesthetics & Places (what it looks/sounds like)
- **Open-roof courts** with arcaded edges (rain drains, sky for the Oboe); woodwind choirs under shade; shell-horn calls at dawn.  
- **Hand-sign choirs** in work yards (counting strokes, loading chants).  
- **Votive objects:** wind-pipes, reed knots, and stamped cadence-leaves hung in doorways.

## Quick Gloss (for the reader)
- **Oboe:** the Sun as conductor of seasons and civic time.  
- **Beat (house):** one of six temple houses; II = Text & Music; V = Charity; VI = Discipline/Courts.  
- **Recension:** a licensed musical-text setting; temple-approved copies carry seals.  
- **Splendid Word:** syncretic current that blends Rhythm with local cults and moral maxims; tolerated, contested.

## Addendum — Pamphlets, Green Edicts & the Switch Years (c.1400–1560 AO)

- **Names & posture.** In pamphlet shorthand, “Old Bold Rhythm” survives the pamphlet century re-branded as the **Good Old Rhythm**—less pure, more police, after the 1503 crisis forces bench/Steps/Works coordination (“Green Edicts”).  
- **Recensions.** **Beat II** reissues plates with marginalia and seals; cross-recognition with Sea-Lotus continues where side-notes suffice; Free Cities accept signed parallel slips.  
- **Discipline.** The spectacle of **deafening** collapses into the civic **Empty Chair** norm; fines substitute for marks in merchant cities; **Beat VI** procedures bleed into Mixed Court process.  
- **Sanctuaries & clinics.** **Beat V** frontages expand kitchens/infirmaries and switch counseling; sanctuary warrants require **Mixed Court** stamps; etiquette (ear-ports, wingsleeves, shrine rails) is codified in ward rules.  
- **Calendars & Switch Hours.** Public calendars remain silent; inspections, clinics, and festival timetables **quietly track** the **Switch Hours** that matter for ward peace.  
- **Sea-Lotus & neighbors.** Antiphon and lustration grammar influence port festivals; Sea-Lotus humanism pushes mercy law; Reed of Crowns keeps its vision-leaves and refuses plate control.
