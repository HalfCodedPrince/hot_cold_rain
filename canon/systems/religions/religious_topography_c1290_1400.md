## Frame
The **Good Old Rhythm** (Ordian core) is a civic-ritual order (six houses, sung law, open-roof courts). Around it are **related rites** and **parallel cults** that share calendars and melodies where convenient, and ignore them where they must.

### Family sketch (not a strict genealogy)
- **Good Old Rhythm (Ord)** → normative six-house structure; Beat II (Text & Music) polices recensions; Beat VI (Discipline) bleeds into law.
- **Sea-Lotus Rite (Sar)** → kin to Rhythm but temple-humanist; antiphonal choirs, lustrations, geometry; skeptical of Beat VI’s cruelty.
- **Reed of Crowns (Knees)** → archaizing, visionary strands; “emanations” theology; ecstatic silence and step-dances; pre-canon habits.
- **Stone-Current / Old Word (Kllrian)** → public minimum of Rhythm; private ancestor-terrace and water-spirit cult; vows kept in stone.
- **Crum-ward Assemblies (Free Cities & western Ord)** → market temples blending Kuzhar **Crum** remnants, Rhythm meters, and local oaths.
- **Totemic streams (Northlands)** → eastern Kahet bird-knives; central river-mothers; western storm-brothers; each overlays Rhythm calendars selectively.

## Recognition & friction (in practice)
- **Calendars:** ports align (convoy seasons); uplands keep rain months.  
- **Texts & tunes:** Ord/Sar recognize each other’s **recensions** with side-notes; Knees accepts tunes, not texts; Kllrian keeps **Old Words** out of Beat II plates.  
- **Discipline:** Sar refuses **deafening**; Free Cities fine instead of brand; Kllrian courts swap penance for corvée; totem tribes ignore all but convoy rules.  
- **Sacral economy:** all accept **Beat V** (charity) collections in disaster years; totem tribes prefer food to sermons.

## Why people move between rites (and how)
- **Merchants** follow **assay & Access Days**; pay in the house that prints the docket.  
- **Migrants & crews** adopt the **lowest-friction** practice in port (Gardens + ward shrines), keep home gods at night.  
- **Marriages** braid rites: Ord–Sar easy; Ord–Knees requires a “two-roof” service; Kllrian insists on a terrace vow engraved later.

## Hooks to era mechanics
- **Pamphlet wars**: Beat II vs compositories; Sar drama schools; Knees vision-leaves; Crum satirists.  
- **Law & premiums**: houses co-sign Fishery Bans; rites argue over “who owns the calendar.”  
- **Kin-Maze**: Elector marriages tug Synod seats; bursaries skew to cousins.
