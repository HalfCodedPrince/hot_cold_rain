## Thesis
Farthest from Ord, **Knees** keeps an older, weirder strain: the Oboe’s light refracted through **“reeds” (emanations)**—crowns of order that descend by stages, in order to protect mind and soul from searing beauty of truth. Scripture is **song + silence**.

## Hallmarks
- **Spaces**: low reed-roof halls; peristyle courts open to wind; torch niches, no high lanterns.  
- **Music**: measured **step-dances** punctuated by held **silences**; shell rattles; drones minimal.  
- **Texts**: **vision-leaves** (short, intense images); **proto-canon** lists instead of long recensions.  
- **Discipline**: **fasts and nights of silence**; public penance as dance; no deafening.  
- **Theology**: Oboe → Crowns (Reeds) → Houses; Beat hierarchy treated as **emanated**, not juridical.

## Frictions & Fits
- **With Ord**: recognizes calendars and charity; rejects Beat II monopoly; accepts mixed bench rituals if silence honored.  
- **With Sar**: swaps dancers and masks for festivals; refuses bath before silence days.  
- **With Kllrian**: comfortable overlap; terrace vows read as a Crown of Earth.
