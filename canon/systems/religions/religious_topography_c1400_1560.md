## Frame (what changed from the prior century)
Cheap paper + convoy travel turn quiet frictions into public contests of **text, tune, and calendar**. The crisis resolves not by theology but by **administration**: the Green Skies (1503) force an era of **sanctuaries, Mixed Courts, and plate-supervised recensions**, after which cities settle into managed pluralism.

### Family sketch (continuities and shifts)
- **Good Old Rhythm (Ord core):** six-house order remains normative; **Beat II** (Text & Music) asserts recension control; **Beat VI** (Discipline) is domesticated into civil process (“**Empty Chair**” replaces spectacle penalties in most ports).  
- **Sea-Lotus Rite (Sar littoral):** temple-humanist; antiphon, lustrations, geometry; pamphlet century elevates drama schools and public debate; after 1503, adopts **sanctuary charities** early.  
- **Reed of Crowns (Knees):** vision-leaves and step-processions continue; accepts tunes, resists plates; least affected by Mixed Courts.  
- **Stone-Current / Old Word (Kllrian):** keeps public minimum; terrace vows and water-spirits continue privately; Mixed Courts interact mostly on kin/property.  
- **Crum-ward Assemblies (Free Cities):** fines over brands; satire and merchant piety frame disputes; strong press norms.

## Arc in three packets (1400–1560)
1) **Pamphlet Heat (1400–1470).** Bench/temple cities see **Beat II vs compositories** fights; Sar littoral stages **lustration marches** and theater polemics; Free Cities prefer satire and fines.  
2) **Hardening & Riots (1470–1503).** Dock riots, boycotts, and a few assassinations; **deafening** dwindles to rare but symbolic acts; calendars become proxy battlegrounds.  
3) **Switch Years & Settlement (1503–1560).** **Green skies** and the **Endless Green** at sea trigger **sanctuary wards**, **Mixed Courts**, and **Green-Edicts-style coordination** between benches, Steps, and Works; recensions reissued with plate side-notes; public peace hinges on clinic compliance and festival timing.

## Recognition & friction (updated practice)
- **Calendars:** Convoy and festival days still align in ports; **Switch Hours** never appear on state calendars, but clinics and inspections quietly track them; upland rain months persist.  
- **Texts & tunes:** Ord/Sar keep **mutual recognition with marginalia**; Knees takes tunes, rejects plates; Kllrian keeps **Old Words** off Beat II plates; Free Cities allow parallel pamphlet recensions if signed.  
- **Discipline:** **Deafening → Empty Chair** in most cities; fines and satyr-posting in Free Cities; sanctuary warrants require **Mixed Court** seals.  
- **Sacral economy:** **Beat V** fronts expand kitchens/infirmaries as part of sanctuary charters; ports accept disaster collections across rites.

## Sea-Lotus in the pamphlet century
- **Public posture:** drama schools as polemic forums; **lustration marches** set a civic ritual counter-grammar to Beat VI spectacle.  
- **After 1503:** quick to normalize **Switch counseling** and clinic bursaries; maintains skepticism of coercive penance; accepts joint Access-Day administration with Rhythm houses.

## Where it’s hot vs quiet (rule-of-thumb map)
- **Ord core (HOT):** bench/temple cities; recension fights and student/dock riots common before 1503; afterward, Mixed Courts and plate side-notes calm the surface.  
- **Sar littoral (WARM):** Sea-Lotus humanism; high print volume; arrests limited; strong sanctuary culture after 1503.  
- **Knees (SPORADIC):** visions, silences, processions; little formal change.  
- **Kllrian uplands (LOW):** public minimum throughout; private terraces unaffected.  
- **Free Cities (LOUD, CAGEY):** sati
