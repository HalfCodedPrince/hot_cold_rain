## Thesis
Knife-pass corridors and alpine meadows feed the **Salt River**; movement flips by season: **ridges in summer, frozen marsh belts north of the crest in winter**.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Structure.** High crest with short, steep windward shoulders; long lee spurs toward interior marsh belts.
- **Drainage.** Headwaters converge into the Salt; braided fans at pass feet.
- **Winds/seasonality.** Snow loads and avalanche chutes on windward; desiccating summer winds on lee.
- **Ground truth.** Mules and highland bovids outnumber horses on windward routes.

## Corridors & gates
- **Kahet Gates.** First all-season ford north of crest; switchback road with toll houses and **oath-stones**.
- **Winter roads.** Frozen marsh belts open north of crest; carts give way to pack trains.
- **Knife passes.** Narrow saddles with cribbing and snow sheds where funded.

## Hazards
Avalanche paths and washouts sever passes in green years; thaw floods cut winter lines; scree fans shift after late storms.

## Era touchpoints
- **1306–1308.** Head-silver declared at the ford; **Ord–Kahet** chartered; nucleus of **Too-Kahet**; terrace courts guaranteed by **Three Gates** concordat.
- **Green Years.** Works contracts fund snow sheds and cribbing; ford maintenance prioritized.

## Rite & law (where to look)
**Stone-Reserves** keep terrace courts private if fairs and oaths keep time; **Rhythm minimum at gates** only. (For procedures, see law/rite pages via links.)

## Legend anchors (map cues)
Kahet Gates ford; switchback toll houses; ridge hugs in summer; winter marsh belts north of crest.
