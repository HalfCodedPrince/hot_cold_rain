## Thesis
String of capes and low peninsulas controlling **lee-arc pilotage** and tollable narrows; **cape forts** and coerced city-states edge into the Ordâ€“Sar sphere.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coast.** Alternating cliff and sand hook capes; hazardous shoals off points; sparse good anchorages.
- **Control.** Fort strings on capes and isthmuses; pilot stairs at tollable narrows; hinterlands thin.

## Lanes & politics
Cape weather rules convoys; forts extract passage dues; coerced city-states act as resupply/hostage hubs.

## Hazards
Lee traps behind hooks in storm sets; sand migration closes minor cuts; water scarcity inland.

## Era touchpoints
Forts modernize slowly; pamphlet era brings more charters than conquest; green years divert convoys to safer lee arcs.

## Legend anchors
Cape forts, toll narrows, pilot stairs, lee hooks, resupply coves.
