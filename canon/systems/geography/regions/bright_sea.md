## Thesis
A shallow-ridge inland seaway whose **Old Song** current stitches Ord and Sar; archipelago shelves create predictable **reef cuts** and lee corridors that make convoyization possible.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Currents:** Old Song (Ord→Sar) on fair winds; return eddies along lee arcs.
- **Wind & seasons:** trade-like summer sets; storm corridors in shoulder months.
- **Bathymetry:** ridge shelf, patch reefs, mangrove fringes west; deep cuts at Seven Fingers.

## Legend anchors (for maps & scenes)
Access nodes: ◯ Koi-Hi · ◯ Vitrana · ◯ Morum.  
Cuts & marks: Seven Fingers reef-cut; fog-mart legs; rope-core relays.

## Era touchpoints (1200–1503)
- 1376: first **Reef-Back Circuit** completed; **Rate-Hold Books** adopt lee rules.
- 1452→: Plate Warrants enable rope-core pamphlet routes; Crum presses ride convoys.
- Green Years: silt blooms flip seasonal flow; **Fishery Bans** rotate; premiums spike.
