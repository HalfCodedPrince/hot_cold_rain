## Thesis
Acidic **fen–mangrove mosaics** with bog-iron extraction camps, nitraries, and penal works along dredged channels.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Substrate.** Peat/fen beds with iron-rich groundwater; mangrove tangles on brackish rims.
- **Water.** Narrow, shifting channels; Works keep **storm curtains** and markers on main cuts.

## Industry & penal works
- **Bog-iron camps → tatara blooms**, tilt hammers inland for bar iron.  
- **Nitraries** on raised beds (urine/ash/earth) feed powder houses; edge-runner mills on firm ground.  
- **Penal labor** rotates dredge loggers, peat cutters, dyke crews.

## Hazards
Acid rot; fever belts; Green-Year surges contaminate pans; channel shifts strand barges.

## Era touchpoints
Powder, iron, and wick quotas spike with convoy wars; pamphlet era whistle-leaf scandals target marsh graft.

## Legend anchors
Storm curtains on channels; raised nitrary beds; tilt hammers; dyke crews and penal camps.
