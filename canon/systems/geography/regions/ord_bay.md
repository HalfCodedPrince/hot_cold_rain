## Thesis
Ord’s arterial basin: **Upper City** rides a levee bend just above the bar’s reach; **Slipway Quarter** at tide-edge runs yards, ropewalks, insurers’ **Steps**, and Mangrove Gardens.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Hydroform.** River plume over a tidal bar; levee bends with natural dock pockets; mangrove rims on slackwater.
- **Lanes.** Bar soundings govern drafts; beacon rows mark dredge slots; bell codes align **Access Days** to convoy windows.

## Works & signals
- **Beacon Rows & Dredge.** Pozzolan quays, oil stores, wick sheds; Access Days bell on bench tower.
- **Graving docks.** Timber cribs/shell-crete, block-shops, capstan yards; slipways line the Gardens edge.

## Law & finance (where to look)
Mirror benches adopt external standards (Morum Exchange 1296); **bench-dockets** and **fee-farms** run the docks; **Black Ledger** postings (post-1492) tag risky crews. See `mixed_courts`, `debt_office`, `green_edicts`.

## Era touchpoints
- **1296:** Morum Exchange (CGW) adopted by mirror benches.  
- **1304:** Great Conference theatres & public health tables posted. 
- **Green Years:** quay repairs funded by **green-year scrip**; Slipway floods ritualized into queue calendars.

## Legend anchors
Upper City (levee bend), Slipway Quarter (tide edge), bar soundings, beacon rows, dredge slots, Gardens stairs.
