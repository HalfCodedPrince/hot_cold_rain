## Thesis
Subpolar fjords and a broad shelf with short summers; **monastery-ports** and amber towns dot ice-margins; salvage and coasters dominate over mass conquest.

## Basemap (invariants)
- **Coast.** Deep fjords, skerries, storm gaps; sea-ice in shoulder seasons.
- **Shelf.** Productive shallows; amber lines on storm beaches; few year-round harbors.

## Lanes & seasons
Short convoy window; ice leads & local knowledge rule; monastery-ports offer pilotage and wintering.

## Hazards
Pack ice, bergy bits, sudden katabatic gusts in fjords; poor shelter density between good ports.

## Era touchpoints
Amber booms after big storms; monastic storehouses serve as relief nodes in green years.

## Legend anchors
Monastery stairs; amber beaches; ice leads; skerry chains; wintering coves.
