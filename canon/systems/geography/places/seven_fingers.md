# Overview
A Sar littoral port whose priest-garb name was misheard as “Seven Fingers” by Ord mariners. Wealth from reef dyes and pilotage sustains thick walls and a proud council.

## Late Marrite Era
- Under Marr, a posted Captain-Representative turns the posting into **de facto rule**, showing other ports the center will not bite.
- **799 AO** — Emerald Shoals defeat.  
- **800 AO** — public trial of Arsu in Ord; levy tickets re-standardized under treaty-port terms.

## Notes
- Prints its own levy tickets; pays tribute irregularly after 776 AO.
- Choirs split: some under Beat Two licensing, others proscribed during the Censor’s Bench purge.
