# Expansion & Frontiers (860–1050 AO)

## What “expansion” means at sea
The empire grows as a **string-of-pearls**: treaty ports, watch posts, beacon legs, convoy rights—not continuous inland provinces.

### Ord (north continent)
- **Ord Bay & Salt River** — integrated core; complete beacon legs; watches certified.  
- **Western Ord littoral** — **loose hegemony** via convoy protection & levy tickets; local councils remain.  
- **Southern Ord city-belts** — evolving toward the later **Hundred Crowns** micro-states; nominal fealty, strong guilds.

### Eastern Ord Peninsula (future Longara)
- **Koi-Hi / Coi-Hi** — rises to triad status; insurance houses, chart schools; proto-Longara civic habits.  
- **Cape stations** — small watch islands securing the Old Song bends.

### Kaheet Mountains & North-Ord tribes
- **Pass treaties** buy guide services & timber; no heavy occupation.  
- **Frontier posts** are depots, not forts.  
  *Matters later:* tribal confederations learn imperial schedules and where they are weak.

### Bright Sea Archipelagos (Kllrian Temple States)
- **Northern arcs** — stable temple city-states; rites mesh with convoy calendars.  
- **Southern arcs** — **Hush Isles** (Cuzhar ruins): partial repopulation; cultural taboo keeps densities low.  
  *Matters later:* taboo breaks under colonial hunger and temple schisms.

### Sar (south continent)
- **Sar littoral city-states** — **treaty-port web** (Seven Fingers model): tribute tables, mixed courts, watch posts.  
- **Inland** — thin reach along navigable rivers only; reed-camp districts persist.

### Widiwidi (far south-west)
- **Probe & Post** era: pepper resins, hardwoods, saps; **seasonal factor** premiums high.  
- **No mass colonization yet**; penal/indenture pilots begin late in the Cadence.  
  *Matters later:* mutation-era routes + colonial appetites point here.

## Why no further “imperial land”
- **Logistics:** still water-first; roads rot; horse culture absent.  
- **Cost curve:** each new bar/beacon leg adds **maintenance debt**.  
- **Politics:** treaty compliance is cheaper than garrisoning; cartels prefer contracts.

## Edge pressures by 1050 AO
- **Silting bars** on western Ord & Sar deltas strain dredge cycles.  
- **Watch bribery** appears where treaty ports game premiums.  
- **Temple fissures** along the frontier rites (Splendid Word updraft).
