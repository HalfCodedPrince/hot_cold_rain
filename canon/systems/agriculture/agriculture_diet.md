## Crops & cycles
**Paddy grains** in deltas; **millet/sorghum** inland; **taro/plantain** belts. Salt-gardens (halophytes); rooftop herbs; rain-garden fruit. 

## Aquaculture & fisheries
Mangrove pond polyculture (milkfish-like + prawns); oyster racks; seaweed rafts. Seasonal closures (spawning); **temple-posted quotas**. 

## Storage & trade
Bast sacks; ceramic jars; depot ice via absorption chillers; coastal granaries on stilts. Staples: rice cakes; dried fish; pickled greens; festival sweets.

## Staples by zone (premodern baseline)
- **Deltas/coasts:** wet rice; taro; plantain; brackish greens; oyster/seaweed condiments.  
- **Uplands/inland:** millet, sorghum; dry rice where feasible; pulses (pigeon pea, cowpea); gourds.  
- **Oils & sweeteners:** sesame, coconut/fish oils; palm/cane/date syrups where climate allows.  
- **Animal protein:** estuary fish, prawns, bivalves; river carp; poultry; occasional goat.

## Processing & preservation
Salt/smoke/dry; vinegar/brines; fish pastes; lactic ferments (greens); starch cakes; temple ice where endowed.

## Kitchen patterns (premodern)
Clay-pot stews over charcoal; steamed starch cakes; flatbreads in inland belts; taro-leaf wraps; pickled relishes.

## Festivals & temple kitchens
Rites fund **public kettles** (pulses + greens); festival sweets from rice starch and syrups; fast-day menus publish substitutions.

## Nutrition notes
Low-lactose habits; seaweed/oyster sauces supply iodine; polished grain preference rises price of greens—temple kitchens counter with ferments.


## c.1800 (industrializing addendum)

### Supply & lanes
- **Convoyed staples** (rice, pulses, salted fish) run regular **festival-cycle** schedules; price boards post expected arrivals.  
- **Bonded warehouses** smooth scarcity; ports issue **grain warrants** redeemable across Steps.  
- **Backhaul** carries oils, sugar, spices, pickles; **ice-legs** move fish inland via insulated chests.

### Milling & refining
- Water/steam mills expand **whitened flours and polished rice**; sieving grades enter tariff tables.  
- **Tempered starches** (noodle sheets, vermicelli) appear in ports; batter-ferments persist in delta towns.

### Oils, sugars & condiments
- Oils: coconut, sesame, reef-fish; **lamp-oil refiners** spin off kitchen grades.  
- Sugars: palm/cane/date syrups; **centrifuged crystals** in richer wards.  
- Condiments: oyster/seaweed sauces, shrimp pastes, citrus brines; pepper and clove arrive by treaty-port chains.

### Markets & regulation
- **Morning wet markets** for fish/greens; **evening dry markets** for grains and sweets.  
- Magistrates post **weights & measures stones**; **adulteration boards** sample oils, tea-bricks, spice cakes.  
- **Price ceilings** during storm years; temple kitchens receive first claim on relief grain.

### Kitchens & apparatus
- Port hearths mix **steamers + brazier woks + clay-pots**; uplands keep flatstone griddles.  
- **Cast-iron pans** and enamel kettles spread with convoy trade; charcoal briquettes replace raw wood in cities.

### Street foods & vendor ecology
- Rice cakes with pickle; noodle bowls; fried dough rings; skewer grills; **brined tofu-like cakes**; seaweed rolls.  
- Vendors ring **shift-hour bells**; guild stalls rotate corners by license; rain screens turn alleys into food arcades.

### Institutional kitchens
- **Temple kettles** (pulses + greens) mark fast-days; **warden’s pots** in ward houses feed night patrols.  
- **Works messes** adopt fixed menus (starch + stew + tea); dock **canteens** trial coupon books.

### Beverages
- Herb teas (salt-and-sour for heat days); **rice beers** in inland belts; sugar-lime coolers in ports; coffee substitutes in poorer wards.

### Nutrition & public health
- **Deficiency clusters** (beriberi-like) track polished-grain spikes; notices push **greens/ferments**.  
- Salt-iodine via seaweed/oyster sauces; **street-water boilers** cut cholera in dense wards.

### Class textures
- **Dock & rope crews:** one-pot stews, starch cakes, fried scraps.  
- **Clerks & traders:** noodle houses, tea stalls, sweet fritters.  
- **Bench houses:** banquet sets (reef fish, young greens, sugar confections) on court days.

### Price signals & measures
- Seasonal **rice/fish spreads** posted beside **assay rings**; warrants list **grade, moisture, broken-grain** percentages.  
- Fines for **short ladles** and **watered brines**; repeat offenders lose stall-days.
