## Crops & cycles
**Paddy grains** in deltas; **millet/sorghum** inland; **taro/plantain** belts. Salt-gardens (halophytes); rooftop herbs; rain-garden fruit. 

## Aquaculture & fisheries
Mangrove pond polyculture (milkfish-like + prawns); oyster racks; seaweed rafts. Seasonal closures (spawning); **temple-posted quotas**. 

## Storage & trade
Bast sacks; ceramic jars; depot ice via absorption chillers; coastal granaries on stilts. Staples: rice cakes; dried fish; pickled greens; festival sweets.

## Staples by zone (premodern baseline)
- **Deltas/coasts:** wet rice; taro; plantain; brackish greens; oyster/seaweed condiments.  
- **Uplands/inland:** millet, sorghum; dry rice where feasible; pulses (pigeon pea, cowpea); gourds.  
- **Oils & sweeteners:** sesame, coconut/fish oils; palm/cane/date syrups where climate allows.  
- **Animal protein:** estuary fish, prawns, bivalves; river carp; poultry; occasional goat.

## Processing & preservation
Salt/smoke/dry; vinegar/brines; fish pastes; lactic ferments (greens); starch cakes; temple ice where endowed.

## Kitchen patterns (premodern)
Clay-pot stews over charcoal; steamed starch cakes; flatbreads in inland belts; taro-leaf wraps; pickled relishes.

## Festivals & temple kitchens
Rites fund **public kettles** (pulses + greens); festival sweets from rice starch and syrups; fast-day menus publish substitutions.

## Nutrition notes
Low-lactose habits; seaweed/oyster sauces supply iodine; polished grain preference rises price of greens—temple kitchens counter with ferments.


## c.1800 (Shana Mutatorem Addendum — Patchwork Modernity)

### Supply & lanes

* **Convoyed staples** (rice, pulses, salted fish) run irregular **festival-cycle** schedules; price boards flicker on battered lightboxes, but the poor listen for news at tea stalls or over the radio.
* **Bonded warehouses** (some rebuilt, some ruined) buffer scarcity; ports issue **grain warrants** printed, posted, or broadcast.
* **Backhaul** brings spices, pickles, factory sugar, salvage, and sometimes “ice-legs” for inland fish—ice is rationed, often gone by noon.

### Milling & refining

* **Electric and steam mills** in ports expand **polished rice** and white bread, but outages send workers back to hand-querns and waterwheels.
* **Factory oils** and mass sugars replace old flavors; tinned sweets and factory loaves appear but are envied and distrusted.
* **Preservation**: canning lines run intermittently; smokehouses and clay jars remain essential.

### Oils, sugars & condiments

* Oils: coconut, sesame, reef-fish, plus new **factory blends** (often adulterated).
* Sugars: palm/cane/date syrups, with **centrifuged crystals** for elites; cheap substitutes common in city alleys.
* Condiments: oyster/seaweed sauces, shrimp pastes, citrus brines; cheap soda, pickled weeds, and off-brand sauces mix with imports.

### Markets & regulation

* **Morning markets** open under neon and ragged awnings; **evening stalls** glow with storm lanterns and green moonlight.
* Black market tables and old soldiers’ canteens crowd alongside corporate food stalls, each with badges and ration chits.
* **Weights & measures stones** are ignored; “assay rings” still test, but bribes and substitutions are common.
* **Price signals** and relief shipments announced by clerk, radio, or rumor—often too late for the hungry.

### Kitchens & apparatus

* **City kitchens**: electric stoves buzz when power holds; most pots still simmer on charcoal or scavenged wood.
* **Cold chains** are fragile; “temple ice” is rare, expensive, and gone by noon.
* Port hearths mix **steamers, woks, clay-pots, enamel and iron pans**—most chipped and salvaged.
* **Street vendors** boil water, hawk rice cakes, fried scraps, brined tofu, soda in recycled bottles beneath flickering rain screens.

### Street foods & vendor ecology

* Rice cakes, noodle bowls, battered fish, fried dough, skewer grills, brined tofu slabs, pickled greens, soda, and street tea.
* Vendor guilds and corporate franchises fight for corners; black market sellers fill the gaps.
* **Shift-hour bells** still ring, but so do air-raid sirens and riot whistles; alleys become food arcades by day, shelters by night.

### Institutional kitchens

* **Temple kettles** serve pulses and greens, but struggle to meet demand.
* **Works messes** and dockside canteens issue fixed starch+stew+tea menus; coupon books accepted, but counterfeits are rampant.
* **Warden’s pots** feed night patrols; old orphans beg soup at temple doors.

### Beverages

* **Herb teas** (salt-and-sour for heat); **rice beers** inland; sugar-lime coolers and off-brand sodas in the ports; chicory and “market brew” substitute for coffee.
* Boiled street water helps keep cholera down in denser wards.

### Nutrition & public health

* **Deficiencies** (beriberi, fever, “market malaise”) follow polished-rice and sugar spikes; clerks and posters urge more greens/ferments, but many districts lack both.
* **Salt-iodine** from seaweed/oyster sauces; “street-water boilers” are public, but outbreaks are common after storms.
* **Relief kitchens** get first claim on imported rice and oil, but shipments are sporadic and corruption is legendary.

### Class textures

* **Dock & rope crews:** scrap pots, rice cakes, fried scraps, market tea.
* **Clerks & traders:** noodle houses, sweet fritters, soda, street coffee.
* **Bench houses:** banquets of reef fish, young greens, tinned sweets, imported confections—on court days, beneath flickering lamps.

### Price signals & measures

* Seasonal **rice/fish spreads** and price ceilings posted by lightbox, radio, or rumor; **assay rings** still grade grain and oil (when they can).
* Fines for **short ladles**, “watered brines,” or adulterated oils are posted, but seldom collected; repeat offenders lose stall-days, or just move stalls.

*The world teeters between progress and decay. Under the green rains, every meal is both hope and memory—patchwork, improvised, and fiercely alive.*
