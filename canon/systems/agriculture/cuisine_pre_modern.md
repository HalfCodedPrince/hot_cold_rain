## Thesis
Everyday cooking is starch + greens + brine, structured by calendars, storage, and lanes; festivals add sugar, oil, and spectacle.

## Pantry
Wet-rice / millet / sorghum; taro/plantain; pulses (pigeon pea, cowpea); gourds; leafy greens; dried fish; oyster/seaweed sauces; vinegars; syrups.

## Techniques
Steam; clay-pot simmer; stir-fry on brazier pans in ports; roasting inland; ferment (greens, fish pastes); smoke/dry.

## Daily table
- **Morning:** starch cake + pickle or fish-brine; herb teas.  
- **Midday (port):** rice + greens + small fish; fried snacks on market days.  
- **Evening:** pulse stew; taro leaves; festival leftovers when in season.

## Street & market foods
Skewers, fried doughs, brined tofu-like cakes, seaweed rolls; vendor bells align to shift hours.

## Festival sets
Sweet starch confections; oil-fried fritters; charity kettles; fast-day substitutions posted by houses/benches.

## Regional notes
- **Deltas/coasts:** oyster/seaweed condiments; palm/cane syrups.  
- **Uplands:** millet flatbreads; goat; dried river fish.  
- **Isles:** breadfruit/taro staples; coconut oil; reef fish.

## Health angles
Temple kitchens fortify with greens/ferments; warn against all-polished rations; public notices track deficiency clusters near mills.
