# Metrology & Calendar (Base‑6 Habits)
ID: MET:CAL-001
Status: WIP

## Numbers
- Everyday arithmetic mixes base‑10 and base‑6; official ledgers preserve base‑6 columns.
- Common fractions: 1/6, 1/36, 1/216 (deni).

## Measures (canonical)
- **Reed** (length), **Shell** (mass), **Cask** (volume); temple standards kept in sealed vaults.
- Tide Steps numbered for each quay (vertical datum).

## Calendar
- Year = **370 days**: 10 “Songs” × 37 days; **6‑day weeks** (“hexads”); 10 festival intercalaries floated by temple board.
- Civic clocks mark **tide hours** in ports; inland keep sun hours.

### Cross‑refs
- systems/governance/law_admin.md (standards enforcement)
- systems/systems/cosmos/index.md (ephemerides)  # adjust path as needed
