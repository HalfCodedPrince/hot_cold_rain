- **“Harbor Collegium”** (Ord) → later **Council of Captains** habit.  
- **“Pilot-Magistrate”** (port officer) → later **Captain-Representative** template.  
- **“Shell-bond”** (inscribed contracts, some on crab shell) → later **printed notes/forms**.  
- **“Flower-Fall”** (pollen rains) → later popular **“green rain.”**
