> **Thesis.** The Bright Sea world in 1503 AO is a **pamphlet-literate, ward-governed, rite-braided** society where ports dictate fashion and calendars, benches arbitrate both **law and mood**, and long-distance convoys knit together a public that knows itself by **access days**, **assay slips**, and the **Good Old Rhythm**—even when they quarrel about its tunes.

## I. Where life happens (ward → bench → convoy)
- **Wards & benches.** City life runs on ward beads and **bench-dockets**; the **Plate** and insurers’ **Steps** post hours, holds, and rates. Ports align their weeks with **Access Days** and beacon legs; uplands still keep rain months and local fairs.  
- **Household economy.** **Guild-organized crafts** (print, rigging, assay, lofts) anchor mixed households; cousins and journeymen share leases, feast-days, and sureties.  
- **Road & sea public.** Convoy timetables and day-marks create a shared “clock”; **assay rings** and warrant houses make strangers legible.

## II. Rites in public (and how they friction)
- **Shared minimum.** The **Good Old Rhythm** frames calendars, charity, and public rites in most ports; Sea-Lotus (Sar) is polite kin; Kllrian terraces keep Old Words off Plate, and the Free Cities’ **Merchant-Priests** blends market oaths with Rhythm meters.  
- **Friction patterns.** Ports take **recognition pacts** (recensions, tunes, fines instead of brands); uplands keep local penances; totem streams obey convoy law and ignore the rest.  
- **Why people switch houses.** Migrants and crews adopt the **lowest-friction** rite in port (Gardens + ward shrines), keep home gods at night; marriages braid ceremonies across houses.

## III. The pamphlet public (music, print, and scuffle)
- **Pamphlet weather.** Compositories, drama schools, and ward theatres run a **call-and-response** culture with benches and pulpits. Lampoons and rebuttal slips cluster around festivals and elections to guild offices.  
- **Censorate vs stage.** Beat II plate benches license texts; Sea-Lotus masters answer with geometry plays and choirs; Free Cities favor **fines-as-theatre** over bans.  
- **Literacy gradient.** Port belts are broadly pamphlet-literate; uplands rely on singers, vision-leaves, and traveling readers.

## IV. Names, speech, and courtesy
- **Names & ledgers.** Ledger names (house-i, demonyms) lead in ports; terrace engravings dominate Kllrian vows; nicknames stick via lampoon.  
- **Registers.** **Market-polite** and **bench-plain** are the big speech registers. Port koiné spreads with convoy clerks; upland speech keeps shrine tones.  
- **Etiquette tells.** Ear-ports, veil routes, and cap doffing signal status and rite; public spaces assume **ear-friendly** hoods and quiet soles in shrines and benches.

## V. Education & theatres of skill
- **Where taught.** Apprenticeship first; collegia in estuaries (assay, pilotage, letters); drama schools do civic training by other means.  
- **What taught.** Accounts, weights, tune-law, convoy arithmetic; stage rhetoric; map-chant and reef songs. Shrine schools teach meter and obedience; Gardens teach contracts.

## VI. Family, kin-maze, and marriage
- **Marriage braids.** Ord–Sar easy; Ord–Knees needs a “two-roof” service; Kllrian vows are later engraved in stone.  
- **Kin politics.** Elector marriages tug Synod seats and bursary flows; cousins matter more than neighbors where colleges and benches interlock.  
- **Care & poor relief.** Beat V (charity) funds public bread on scarcity days; Free Cities supplement with guild-box loans and Gardens kitchens.

## VII. Urban vs upland temper
- **Port belt.** Mixed courts (guild/temple), printed dockets, festival calendars, drama as civic argument; wider tolerance paired with sharper lampoon.  
- **Uplands & valleys.** Rain-month calendars, oath-stones, and shrine courts; hospitality strict, politics face-to-face; lampoons travel as songs more than leafs.

## VIII. Leisure, food, and festivals
- **Feasts & fairs.** Hexad festivals mesh rite calendars and access scheduling. Pilgrimage traffic wears the same convoy shoes as trade.  
- **Foodways.** Coasts and deltas favor fish, mangrove greens, and salt breads; uplands prize herd fats and terrace grains. Public eating marks wards: Fifth-Bread porches in Rhythm cities; Gardens market-stalls in Free Cities.

## IX. Law, order, and the reach of things
- **Benches & Steps.** Law is half sung, half docketed. Benches post fees; **Steps** post premiums and holds; both lean on guilds for execution.  
- **Centralizing drift.** Passport plates, fee-farms, and monopoly slices creep outward from the Principality; Free Cities imitate when cash-starved.  
- **Punishments on paper.** Branding wanes in ports; **fines-as-theatre** wax; oaths and closures travel with convoys.

## X. Writer’s hooks (eve-of-1503)
- A festival week where **plate benches** and **choirs** trade barbs; a convoy delayed until the Gardens’ kitchens calm a grain line; a two-roof wedding that must satisfy both terrace stone and port docket.
