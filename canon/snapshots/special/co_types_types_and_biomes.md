> **Scope.** Who shows up **where** (and doing **what**). Uses administrative **lines** (Bat, Otter, Fox) with ward-level **dialects** collapsed under them; wards still treat dialects as their **own “types.”**

## 0) World baseline (why the map looks like this)
Population by biome (ports + forests dominate):  
- Temperate rainforest **~33%**, Temperate deciduous **~25%**, Tropical rainforest **~19%**, Wetlands **~14%**, Tropical seasonal forest **~6%**, Taiga **~4%**; tundra/grassland/savanna are tiny; deserts nil.  
→ Expect **riverine/littoral** and **canopy-adjacent** lines to be common; true steppe/dryland flavors are marginal.

## 1) Lines & Dialects (admin “lumps” ←→ ward “splits”)
We list **admin line → ward dialect(s)**. Dialects are **registered as dialects**, but most wards **treat them like separate kinds**.

### A. **Otter line** (riverine/littoral majority)
- **Core morphology:** partial webbing; dense coat; dive-reflex; ear baffles common; tool-happy hands.  
- **Dialects (ward splits):**
  - **Reedcat** *(scansorial dialect)* — humid forests/wetlands; stronger wrist/ankle flexion, whisker prominence; favors rigging/lofts.  
  - **Cold-otter** *(taiga dialect)* — tighter underfur; snow-muffling ear baffles; cold endurance.
- **Guild niches:** flood crews, salvage, locks, river pilots, barge canopy crews, print lofts (Reedcat).  
- **Clothing accents:** hydro-weave layers, quick-drain hems, ear baffles; reed-edge trims that dry fast.

### B. **Fox line** (road & market majority)
- **Core morphology:** craniofacial lengthening; mobile pinnae; fine pelage; distance-gait tendons; heat-coping kit.  
- **Dialects (ward splits):**
  - **Longfoot** *(distance-gait dialect)* — springy Achilles, padded forefeet; shrine runners, factor couriers.  
  - **Cold-fox** *(taiga dialect)* — thicker ear bases; snow glare veils.
- **Guild niches:** messengers, factor courts, Steps clerks/copyists, convoy runners.  
- **Clothing accents:** vented crowns (ear ports + evaporative pads at **pinna roots**), open-weave half-capes with shoulder vents, sweat-channel seams, scent-safe inks.

### C. **Bat line** (urban density specialist)
- **Core morphology:** elongate forearm/digits II–V with flank membrane; scapular/pectoral remodel; manipulating thumbs intact.  
- **Dialects (ward splits):**
  - **Tower-bat** — beacon legs, bell-towers; stronger vestibular “calm” at height.  
  - **Quay-bat** — shorter hops, wind-hoods; packet lofts & rigging familiarity.
- **Guild niches:** night inspection, signal runners, bell-tower/beacon access, packet lofts.  
- **Clothing accents:** wingsleeves (membrane-safe cuffs), shoulder cradles, membrane oil & patch tabs; **no armor aloft**.

> **Note on collapse:** Earlier “Marten/Pineweasel/Longfoot” are now dialects under Otter/Fox. Admin ledgers lump them; ward life splits them.

## 2) Prevalence by biome (Common / Uncommon / Rare)
| Biome | Otter line | Fox line | Bat line | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tropical rainforest** | **Common** (Reedcat frequent) | **Common** (Longfoot frequent on market roads) | **Common** in dense ports | High humidity → otter toolkit shines; bats thrive in tall canopies/ports |
| **Temperate rainforest** | **Common** | **Common** | **Common** | The world’s biggest share of people lives here; all three lines present |
| **Temperate deciduous** | **Common** along rivers/wetlands | **Common** (road nets) | **Uncommon → Common** (by city size) | |
| **Wetlands** | **Very common** | **Uncommon** (dialects cluster on levees) | **Common** (quay-bats) | Otter-led guilds dominate locks, flood crews |
| **Tropical seasonal forest** | **Common** along deltas | **Common** | **Uncommon → Common** (by port density) | |
| **Taiga** | **Uncommon → Common** (Cold-otter) | **Uncommon → Common** (Cold-fox) | **Uncommon** (tower-bats at frost beacons) | |
| **Tundra/Grassland/Savanna** | **Rare** | **Uncommon** on roads | **Rare** | Small populations overall |
| **Deserts** | **Rare** | **Rare** (night runners) | **Rare** | Minimal population footprint |

**Urban overlay (trumps biome):**  
- **Bat** prevalence rises with **ward density**, bell-towers, and packet houses.  
- **Otter** rises with **locks/floodworks**, salvage, mangrove ordinances.  
- **Fox** rises with **factor courts**, courier guilds, and long road nets.

## 3) City patterns (what a census looks like)
Typical **hot-belt port** (e.g., Longara):  
- Otter **high**, Fox **high**, Bat **medium-high**; Reedcat & Quay-bat dialects visible; sanctuary clinics busy; Mixed Court docket thick with guild disputes.

Typical **temperate river capital**:  
- Otter **high** (locks/flood crews), Fox **high** (administration), Bat **medium** (beacons, inspection).

Typical **taiga mart**:  
- Cold-otter **medium**, Cold-fox **medium**, Tower-bat **low–medium**; winter convoys + beacon legs.

## 4) Work kits by biome (adds onto the line standards)
**Humid tropics:** anti-mildew finishes; quick-dry hems; scent-safe soaps; fox caps carry larger evaporative pads at ear bases.  
**Cold rainforests/taiga:** ear baffles and snow glare veils; otter/oil-felt mitts; bat membrane oils with cold stabilizers.  
**Wetlands/deltas:** anti-slip varnish top-ups; otter reed-edge trims; fox quiet soles for slick stone.  
**High cities (towers):** bat launch pegs & mast straps standardized; aux-beacon codes posted at roof-walks.

## 5) Guild hooks (who hires whom, quickly)
- **Steps**: fox clerks and runners; bat inspectors for night closures.  
- **Harbor Watches**: otter flood crews; bat signal teams; fox court ushers.  
- **Packet Houses**: bat lofts, fox clerks, otter salvage.  
- **Print & Plate**: reedcat riggers in lofts; fox copyists; bat couriers for sealed packets.  
- **Mixed Courts**: fox scribes; otter witness crews in flood/lock incidents.

## 6) Etiquette & signage (keep the streets readable)
- **Beacon legs**: aux patterns warn of volant activity at roof level.  
- **Rails & ramps**: membrane-safe rails at shrine steps; anti-slip stones at flood doors.  
- **Caps & hoods**: ear-port etiquette—never yank a fox hood or pinch a bat wing seam; fines apply in Free Cities (satyr fines posted).

## 7) Quick tables (for ward/pop flavor)

**A. Settlement composition (d8 + density mod):**  
1–2: Predominantly **Fox** (courts/roads)  
3–4: Balanced **Fox/Otter**  
5: Predominantly **Otter** (locks/flood)  
6: **Otter + Bat** pockets (ports)  
7: **Fox + Bat** pockets (dense towers)  
8: Three-line mix; dialects visible

**Density mod:** +1 in big ports; –1 in hamlets; if Taiga, shift one step toward **Cold-** dialects.

**B. Dialect sighting (d6):**  
1: None obvious today  
2: **Reedcat** riggers on a loft  
3: **Quay-bat** signaling from a mast  
4: **Longfoot** couriers sprinting the road  
5: **Cold-otter** with snow baffles drying at a stove  
6: **Cold-fox** with glare veil in the market

## 8) Writer’s palette (to keep scenes consistent)
- In humid wards, **paper smells** ride your descriptions; otters shake water **once** at the door; foxes adjust ear vents the way humans adjust hats; bats check **up** before stepping **out**.  
- In taiga marts, **ear baffles** and **oiled felt** are the visual shorthand; bat launch pegs frost over; fox runners leave **long, quiet tracks**.

### Appendix — Heat notes for **Fox line** (carry to clothing & staging)
- **Radiative shielding vs convection:** guard hairs reflect, underfur thins in hot belts.  
- **Ear-based cooling:** large, mobile pinnae + evaporative pads at **pinna roots** under a **vented crown**.  
- **Sweat where it matters:** eccrine on face/neck/palms; panting is **not** their tool; shade and water breaks are normal, not shameful.  
- **Behavioral kit:** cool-floor sleeping, midday shade work; scent-safe inks/papers to avoid **smell binding** in heat.
