> **Scope & use.** A compact, in-world ledger of what people **saw**, what schools **claimed**, what the Plate **suppressed**, and how the event **phased**. Keep explanations plural and arguable; this document is written as if by a careful collegium scribe under Plate oversight.

## What happened (observables everyone agrees on)
- **Sky & air.** Mid-year, daylight ran **green-tinted** for weeks in belts and along wind lanes. Rain left **green grit**; cisterns skinned with film.  
- **Bloom fields.** Offshore, **endless green** mats formed—rafts, slicks, and towered **kelp/moss spires** along current shears.  
- **Bodies.** In the months that followed, **newborns and infants** appeared with **stable, recurring morphs** (later called **Co-Types**). A **smaller** number of adults showed partial changes (skin, cartilage).  
- **Maps.** Hot spots clustered in **wet littoral, deltas, rainforests, and dense ports**; inland dry belts saw little.

## The three explanations (all active, none decisive)
1) **Bloom Theory** *(collegia majority)* — Airborne **green-bloom motes** and weather alignments; exposure windows in the womb (“**Switch Hours**”). Predicts geography and timing **well**, individual outcomes **poorly**.  
2) **Heavenly Fire** *(Beat houses & pulpits)* — A **solar year** of too-much light; a visitation; a call to discipline. Predicts **piety**, not maps.  
3) **Mangrove Fault** *(navigators, Factors’ Row)* — Sea made many; **packet lanes** carried it inland. Predicts **port-first** patterns, not upland pockets.

> **Bench whispers (sealed):** Some collegia note an **old Switch Complex** in samples; publication requires Plate seals. Street talk reduces this to “forbidden switches.”

## Phasing (consensus timeline)
- **Year 0–2 (Event & Aftermath).** Green skies; rumor flood; **first Co-Type births**; spike in **nonviables** (euphemism: *greenborn*). **Health closures** of wards in hot belts; navigators’ tales of the **Endless Green** harden.  
- **Year 3–10 (Recognition & Law).** **Sanctuary wards** chartered in ports; **Switch counseling** spreads; the first **Mixed Courts**; **pamphlet wars** rage.  
- **Year 10–30 (Normalisation & Control).** Co-Type guild niches are embedded; **Green Edicts** consolidate packet/print/identity control; prevalence stabilizes near **5–7%** in many cities (higher in hot belts).

## Switch Hours (what midwives actually use)
- **Definition.** A **handful of gestational windows** where exposure appears to decide **“which way a child resolves”** (baseline or one of a **few canalized morph packages**).  
- **Tools.** **Switch Ledgers** (sealed), rinse-time cards, roof-walk cautions on **green days**, incense/smoke to “quiet the Switch,” fasting schedules.  
- **Street behavior.** Calendars spawn **Switch Almanacs** beside Access Boards; blame and comedy follow the numbers.  
- **Official posture.** Plate downplays the clocks **in public** and quietly times **clinic hours** by them.

## Sea-rumor module: Oboe & the “Crab/Fish-people”
- **What is seen.** Kelp walls **sing** in wind and swell; tired crews hear **two tones** at night. Lost masks snag in weed; packets vanish in green years.  
- **What is said.** navigators claim the **Oboe speaks** through bloom; dockside cults stencil **claws** on Access Boards and whisper that Co-Types are **shore echoes** of a deeper shape.  
- **What is known.** Infrasound and kelp volatiles cause **pareidolia**; drownings and delirium do the rest. **No verified “sea Co-Types.”** Plate fines the songs when riots loom.

## Geography of risk (why some wards changed more)
- **Amplifiers.** **Humidity**, **diet** (fish oils, bloom-fed stock), **roof-water storage**, **festival crowding**, **packet proximity**.  
- **Dampers.** Stone-lined cisterns, steep roofs, tight-louver shrines, **well-kept traps**.  
- **Note.** Urban density **magnified** exposure differences; “same city, different fate” is common.

## Administrative & medical response (how the state learned)
- **Registers.** Steps compile **mortality/morbidity ledgers**; Mixed Courts log outcomes by ward and convoy.  
- **Closures.** “**Blue notices**” justify **packet holds**, **print seizures**, and **health closures** in hot wards.  
- **Clinics.** Sanctuary clinics standardize **midwife kits** (veil combs, rinse cards, ear baffles, oiled felt, salt lozenges).  
- **Publication.** Manuals circulate; theory is **Plate-throttled**; private correspondence carries the rest.

## Lexicon (to keep usage steady)
- **Co-Type** (official) vs street slurs (avoid in narration).  
- **Switch Hours**, **greenborn** (nonviable euphemism), **overswitch** (developmental cancers, coded).  
- **Green Year**, **Endless Green**, **Blue notice**, **health closure**.  
- **Mixed Court**, **Sanctuary Ward**, **Packet Hold**.

## Taxonomy note (dialects & lines)
- Minor lines (e.g., **cold-adapted otter**, **distance-gait fox**) are recorded in registers as **dialects** of their major packages, but **wards treat them as distinct “types.”** This document follows the administrative lumping; street life does not.

## Writer knobs (safe dials you can turn later)
- **More tragedy early:** raise **overswitch** in Years 0–2; bring it down with clinic practice.  
- **Less mysticism:** move cults into clear politics; keep songs but show fines.  
- **More mysticism:** add one sealed inquiry after a packet vanishes; never confirm.

### Evidence ledger (for editors only; not for print)
- **Strong:** spatial clustering with green-bloom years; improved neonatal outcomes with rinse schedules and closures; clinic records that **timed** Switch counseling.  
- **Weak:** individual prediction of morph; any link between **Oboe songs** and outcomes; any **sea-only** Co-Types.
