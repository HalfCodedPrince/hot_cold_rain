## The Slow Choke
- **Maintenance debt:** bars silt; channels narrow; beacon routes slip from “continuous” to “gappy.” Works bid prestige first; repairs later.
- **Duration creep:** Debt Office rolls dredge/beacon paper beyond service life; maturities stack on festival cycles.
- **Cartel drag:** Harbor Watches + Insurance Steps + Works collude informally; premiums rise; claims stall on paperwork.
- **Soft-censor creep:** Beat Six warrants broaden; House Two editions slow foreign recensions; compositories learn to self-censor.
- **Labor leakage:** penal transports cut corners; guard pay late; petty rackets bloom; “quiet theft” of spare parts becomes normal.

## The First Hammer — Great Lantern Cycle (1098–1102)
A storm decade strands half-maintained beacons; three major wreck years; insurers cite “improper ranges” to deny. Riots on the Steps; auditors find **double-pledged dredge notes**.

## The Second Hammer — The Upland Confederations (1120s)
Pass confeds cut inland timber/ore roads; torch depots and fairs; convoy inputs thin; ports keep law **on paper** while feeding local strongmen off-book.

**Matters later:** Captain-Representatives turn patrimonial; Synod splits over relief vs doctrine; treaty ports drift toward **Contract Port** jurisprudence.
