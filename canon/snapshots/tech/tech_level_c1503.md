## Thesis (what year 1503 looks like in practice)
Post–Green Skies cities keep their old rites and façades, but the **machinery underneath is modernizing by administration**: print is cheap, ledgers are dense, inspections are routine, and **insurance + Mixed Courts** steer what work gets done and how. Powder is established, artillery is credible in sieges, oceangoing logistics are dependable in convoy seasons, and **colony-style extraction** is becoming economically viable—still pre-steam, but on a steady ramp toward the last war two centuries out.

> **Legend** for each line: **Common** (widespread), **Localized** (exists in hubs), **Emerging** (present but fragile/costly), **Not yet** (outside period).

## Materials & Energy
- **Iron & steelwork** — **Common**: bloomery & finery forge iron; case-hardening and selective quench for tools/edges. **Localized/Emerging**: small crucible steel batches in rich ports. **Not yet**: coke, rolling mills, Bessemer/Siemens.
- **Non-ferrous** — **Common**: bronze/brass/copper fittings; lead pipe/weights; tin in short supply drives re-use. **Emerging**: better wire-drawing for instruments.
- **Energy sources** — **Common**: human/animal, watermills, windmills. **Not yet**: steam prime movers.
- **Glass & ceramics** — **Common**: crown glass panes, optical craft adequate for quadrant/astrolabe; stoneware tiles/retorts in print/chemistry shops.

## Printing, Ledgercraft & Instruments
- **Press tech** — **Common**: wood- and copper-plate work; cheap pamphlets; guild & civic print norms. **Localized**: high-quality plate houses in Free Cities/ports.
- **Recensions & side-notes** — **Common in ports**: plate-sealed recensions with marginalia; **Mixed Courts** arbitrate postings & seizures.
- **Measuring & nav instruments** — **Common**: balances, hourglasses, simple clocks; **Localized**: mariner’s astrolabe, cross-staff, improved compasses, tide-tables maintained by benches.

## Communications & Administration
- **Beacons & bells** — **Common**: tower-leg **aux patterns** (closures, floods, green-rain days); bell codes standardized between Works and benches.
- **Packet systems** — **Localized/Common**: sealed-packet lofts, signed courier chains; city factors’ lanes protected by fines-as-theatre instead of spectacle penalties.
- **Courts & inspection** — **Common**: **Mixed Courts** for cross-rite civil peace; **Green Edicts** require posted kit norms and clinic windows; inspection grades on guild doors and beacon legs.

## Transport & Hulls
- **Road & river** — **Common**: paved approaches to marts; lock-tenders and dredge crews keep river spines workable; convoy insurance shapes schedules/routes.
- **Sea** — **Common**: ocean-ranging hulls with mixed rigs; sound convoy seasons; port cranes, slings, shear-legs. **Emerging**: heavier mast/yard sets for blue-water freighting.
- **Lift & rigging** — **Common**: standardized slings; line-kit etiquette (ear-ports, wingsleeves respect, shrine-rail clearance) enforced by ward rules.

## Weapons & Fortification
- **Powder** — **Common**: serpentine powder for handgonnes & bombards; **Emerging**: corned powder in wealthy ports (better burn, logistics-friendly).  
- **Small arms** — **Common/Localized**: handgonnes, early arquebuses, matchlock trials; crossbows remain competitive.  
- **Artillery** — **Localized/Emerging**: battering bombards for sieges; iron/stone shot; improved carriages. **Not yet**: standardized field artillery trains.  
- **Fortifications** — **Emerging**: angled earthworks and lower, thicker walls appear around rich ports; **Common**: legacy high-wall towns with expedient glacis.

## Medicine, Public Health & Co-Type Safety
- **Clinics & sanctuaries** — **Common**: ward sanctuaries maintain **A/B drill** readiness; Switch counseling bursaries; temple bathhouses double as clinics in humid wards.  
- **Ordinances** — **Common**: veils/hoods on green-rain days; named torts (membrane-pinch, smell-binding injury, cold-water negligence) recognized; fines escalate to closures.  
- **Water & waste** — **Common**: covered drains in market cores; cesspit licensing; **Localized**: ward-scale bathhouse heating and laundry schedules.

## Finance, Insurance & State Capacity
- **Revenue & debt** — **Common**: predictable tax farming and fee schedules; chartered benches co-sign with the Synod; levy swaps during convoy season.  
- **Insurance** — **Common**: convoy, warehouse, and workshop premiums; **A/B drill** compliance and inspection grades lower rates.  
- **Records** — **Common**: plate seals on warrants/edicts; ledgers standardized across marts; festival clocks retimed lawfully in green years.

## Agriculture & Extraction
- **Crops & storage** — **Common**: post-crisis diversification and better storage norms; **Localized**: canal-side grain exchanges; salt & fish glue trades stabilize hull/rigging supply.  
- **Forestry & fuel** — **Common**: controlled cutting for mast timber; charcoal management by ward quotas.

## Signals, Time & Calendars
- **Calendars** — **Common**: state calendars omit **Switch Hours**; clinics/inspections keep quiet schedules; Access Days harmonized with festivals.  
- **Timekeeping** — **Common**: civic clocks sufficient for muster, not for fine artillery shooting; hourglasses/knotted lines standard at sea.

## Edges & Not-Yet (for scene sanity)
No steam power; no mass-produced interchangeable parts; no long-range precision artillery; no chemical industry beyond artisanal dyes/inks/salts; optics good enough for navigation and surveying but not telescopes; medical theory pre-germ, with strong **procedural** mitigations via clinics and sanctuaries.

## Play Hooks & Bench Levers (GM quick use)
- Inspection **grade letter** on a guild door opens or blocks a heist.  
- A **corned-powder** shipment changes a siege’s timetable.  
- **Access Day** colliding with a festival forces retiming through a Mixed Court hearing.  
- A ward loses its **A/B drill** rebate; insurers arrive with clipboards.  
- **Packet loft** sealed slips get seized; printers answer with parallel slips and satire.
