## Thesis (what money feels like after the Green Skies)
The Principality’s markets look “old” on the surface (coins, carts, fairs), but underneath they’re run by **ledgers, seals, and risk pricing**. After 1503, ward peace and work are steered by **Mixed Courts + insurers** more than by proclamations. That administrative spine enables **colonial-style extraction** to become thinkable (chartered posts, staple monopolies, transport bonds)—still pre-steam, but on a credible ramp to large, organized wars two centuries away.

---

## Money & Media of Exchange
- **Coin:** local copper/small-silver for day trade; regionally respected silver for wholesale; gold appears in port-to-port settlements. Debasement dramas exist but are rare in beacon-corridor cities.  
- **Non-coin media:** warehouse receipts and **sealed tallies** circulate among factors; bills of exchange exist between trusted marts (slow clearance, high trust premium).  
- **Valuation:** grain, salt, iron, and tar serve as practical yardsticks; convoy insurance premia quietly anchor expectations.

## Credit & Risk
- **Instruments:** short merchant loans, bottomry on hulls, crop liens, and **transport bonds** for overland caravans.  
- **Security:** plate seals on contracts; **Mixed Courts** adjudicate defaults and seize pledged goods; riot/flood risks priced by ward inspection grade.  
- **Post-1503 changes:** compliance with **A/B drills** and kit postings lowers rates; Access Day coordination reduces disruption risk.

## Prices & Staples (rule-of-thumb)
- **Up:** saltpeter, fine timber, tar/pitch, clean copper plate, quality paper, corned powder (where available).  
- **Flat/stable:** grain and fish in convoy season, charcoal in forest belts, basic linen/wool.  
- **Volatile:** lamp oil, dyes, iron bar stock after sieges, imported spices/resins.

## Trade Architecture
- **Corridors:** river spines with locks and dredged bars; ridge roads between marts; blue-water convoys in set seasons.  
- **Nodes:** beacon/port cities (customs + factor courts), inland marts (fairs + storage), estate towns (grain, timber).  
- **Friction:** internal tolls, guild benches, and rite calendars; post-1503 **Green Edicts** align **Access Days** so clinics/inspections don’t choke festivals or convoys.

## Taxation, Fees & State Capacity
- **Receipts:** gate/bridge/harbor dues; stall fees; salt & iron imposts; court stamps; occasional war levies.  
- **Administration:** benches co-sign with Synod offices; audits are ledger-first; **fines-as-theatre** replace spectacle penalties.  
- **Continuity from Camra Dona:** political churn, but social/economic machinery remains predictable; bureaucratic overreach travels through **insurance requirements, inspections, and seals**, not night arrests.

## Insurance & Assurance
- **Lines:** convoy/cargo, warehouse, workshop, and public-house liability.  
- **Pricing:** ward **inspection grade** and **A/B drill** compliance feed premium tables; Mixed Court judgments set precedents; beacon-leg postings signal risk to buyers.  
- **Payouts:** require plate-sealed inventories and witness slips; sanctuaries serve as intake points in green-rain weeks.

## Labor & Organization
- **Guilds & houses:** regulate wages, apprenticeships, safety kit; sanctuary charters pull clinics into work rhythms.  
- **Contracts:** day labor, seasonal crews, indentures (in Free Cities and frontier posts), convoy shares; Switch-counseling time is increasingly recognized as **paid civic time** in ports.  
- **Co-Type integration:** ward rules codify **ear-port/wingsleeve/shrine-rail etiquette**; named torts create duty-of-care standards in presses, lofts, and docks.

## Colonial Vectors (early signs, not yet empires)
- **Chartered posts:** factors petition for exclusive staples (saltpeter, resin, copper, dyes) in distant harbors; charters require **Mixed Court** clauses and Access Day compliance.  
- **Survey & claim:** benches issue limited survey rights for timber and ore; escort shares offered in convoy season.  
- **Labor supply:** transport bonds and term contracts appear around new posts; sanctuaries negotiate minimums (food, clinic windows, kit).

## Information & Enforcement
- **Print & posting:** price sheets, auction bills, inspection grades; slander/seizure fights go through **Mixed Courts**.  
- **Signals:** tower-leg **aux patterns** for closures/floods; festival retiming notices carry plate seals; courier packets connect factor courts.

---

## Edges & Not-Yet (for scene sanity)
No central banks; no paper money beyond receipts/bills among elites; no futures exchanges; limited long-distance price integration outside convoy seasons; local tolls remain meaningful; coastal blockade capacity is situational and season-bound.

## Play Hooks (quick GM levers)
- A ward loses its inspection **grade** → insurers jack premiums → a guild strikes for kit upgrades.  
- A **charter** for saltpeter is contested; Sea-Lotus printers flood the courts with pamphlets; Mixed Courts set a posting schedule.  
- A seized **bill of exchange** lacks a proper plate seal; the buyer needs a forged marginalia or a court miracle.  
- A convoy’s **Access Day** collides with a festival; retiming triggers dock riots unless the bench posts in time.  
- A port’s **A/B drills** slip; insurers downgrade the whole harbor for a season.
