> **Scope.** This is a **pre-mutation snapshot**: conditions across the network in the months leading to 1503 AO and the *morning of* the Day of Green Skies. Use ERA-09 for the street heat and refugee vectors; details of the emergency **Green Edicts** are referenced here only as *anticipated measures*.

## Signals & Rates (what’s twitching)
- **Green-belt anomalies** persist in the warm belts; fish failures → **bread spikes** in ports; insurers post tighter convoy windows and talk surcharge.  
- **Pamphlet velocity** is at peak: lampoons, rebuttals, apologia; Steps keep “**Cleanliness Tables**” as ratings drift toward soft bans.  
- **Festival calendars under strain:** Access Days are being **weaponized** (boycotts, show closures, turn-back fetches).  
- **Assassination rumors** and **dock fights** hover at the edge of pogrom in a few wards; Free Cities keep fines ready.

## Heat Map (where it runs hot)
- **Ord core (HOT):** Bench/temple city; **Beat II** vs compositories; **student & dock riots** recurring; **Beat VI** clerks targeted.  
- **Tau-Hi & Sar littoral (WARM):** **Sea-Lotus** humanists; lustration marches; print everywhere, arrests few.  
- **Seven Fingers / Koi-Hi / Vitrana / Morum (WARM):** **boycotts** and Access leverage; playhouse sackings; plate seizures; a couple of kills.  
- **Knees (SPORADIC, WEIRD):** **Reed visions**, procession ecstasies; blood rare.  
- **Kllrian uplands (LOW):** Public quiet; private **Stone-Current** intact.  
- **Free Cities (LOUD, CAGEY):** **Satyr plays** and fines stand in for brands.  
- **Northlands & Stern marts (LOW):** Fog-gate ports pass **samizdat** quietly and shut gates when needed.

## Political Map (who holds what, morning-of)
- **Great Ord–Sar Principality:** diet still sits; cousins still pull ladders; benches, **Steps**, and **Works** cooperate unevenly.  
- **Free Cities:** high print freedom, mercenary policing, export of satire and lawyers.  
- **Sar Littoral:** Sea-Lotus congregations strong in the deltas; humanist presses linked to port bursaries.  
- **Knees & Western Archipelagos:** rites and reed-houses tight and inward; outward trade steady but nervous.  
- **Northlands / Ord-Kahet & Too-Kahet:** upland confederations are calm but cash hungry; port charters keep the peace on paper.

## Lanes & Logistics (Access & paper)
- **Access Days Boards** keep the calendars but enforcement is now *performative* (ratings, queue shaves, hush fines).  
- **Convoy paperwork** remains predictable in the core; outer lanes see **hold-and-search** justified as plate inspection.  
- **Postal packets** are rumored for tighter control; private runners still fill gaps between ports and collegia.

## Refugees & Enclaves (vectors)
- **Ord → Sar & Free Cities:** printers, students, “**Splendid Word**” clergy; settle near **Lotus Baths** and **Crum Assemblies**.  
- **Knees diaspora:** reed-dance houses mushroom along Free City quays and in Vitrana wards.  
- **To Widiwidi / Southern Sar:** port exiles charter **Co-Type** enclaves (company charters, mixed courts).  
- **Kllrian “quiet exits”:** terrace scholars slip to Ord-Kahet and Stern marts; **Stone Rooms** keep the Old Word.

## Church & Confession (fault-lines before the break)
- **Good Old Rhythm** still frames the public peace, but the fight is over **text & mode** (Beat II and the guild plates), **discipline spillover** (Beat VI), and cadence vs rain (ports vs uplands).  
- **Deafening** is now rare, mostly symbolic; its memory fuels pamphlet rage.  
- **Syncretic edges:** **Sea-Lotus** and **Splendid Word** currents widen civic tolerance gaps city-to-city.

## Print, Stage & Street
- **Compository houses** run hot; seizures of unsealed plates are common pretexts for raids.  
- **Playhouses** swing between satyr fines (Free Cities) and sackings (port wards in Ord-facing cities).  
- **Pamphlet choreography:** rebuttal leafs bundled with festival programs; “safety choruses” appended to contentious sermons.

## Arms, Watches & Riot Weather
- **Watches** prefer fines and closures; **Steps** coordinate docks and beacons.  
- **Matchlocks/handgonnes** exist at the edges (guards, mercenaries), more as deterrent than field doctrine.  
- **Ward signals:** short/short/long still means “disperse & clear a lane” in most core ports.

## Environment — “Green Rain”
- **Tinted rainfall** days increase with pollen storms; nuisance-level health impacts in towns, with historic toxic blooms remembered.  
- **Management habits:** gutter traps, roof/laundry routines, temple advisories posted at ward shrines.


## What to Watch (imminent)
- **Emergency convocation** rumored for a **Green Edicts** package (identity rolls, convoy/packet monopolies, censor plates, fee-farm extensions, Co-Type charters).  
- **Trigger conditions:** another fishery ban cycle + a dock killing in a hot ward could push benches/Steps/Works into a single **reachy** machine by sundown.
