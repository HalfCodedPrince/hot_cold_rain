- **Western Loess & Lakes** — polders and peat; reed towns, pole-roads, winter sledges.

## Bright Sea (between Ord & Sar)
- **Kllrian Arc** — temple-city terraces and causeway ports; flood calendars and choir pageants.  
- **Hush Isles** — taboo ruins attributed to Cuzhar Krum; salvage and pilgrimage under supervision.

## Sar (littoral & jungle)
- **Littoral City Belts** — dye, salt, fishponds; stepped shrines; tight guild courts.  
- **River Jungles** — long-house river towns; bark-cloth ledgers; seasonal war canoes.
