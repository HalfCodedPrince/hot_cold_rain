## Materials & Siting
- **Lowlands:** wood, bamboo, rammed earth; stilted or on pylons; airflow below.
- **Urban cores:** brick, tile, concrete; patchwork postwar infill and shack belts.

## Features
- **Steep overhangs** with wide eaves; **spitter drains** cast water clear of walls.
- **Vent screens:** slats, perforated brick, woven mats; rain-baffled, breeze-friendly.
- **Courtyards/airwells:** drain sumps and rain gardens.
- **Flood logic:** ground floors for storage/shops; living levels above; verandas as social streets.

## Surface & Color
Weathered paints (ochre/green/red), mosaic tiles at thresholds, sun/sea/music motifs; iron grilles and carved rain chains.

**City image:** capes and veils in lanes, squat umbrellas; stilt rows and fish-scale tiles; overhang spouts pouring into laughing gutters.
