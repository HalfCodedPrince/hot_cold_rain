## State Pensions
- **Exist but thin:** meager stipends, months late; local skims and “paper errors” common.
- **Veteran rolls:** formal on paper; **lost records** and gatekeeping exclude many. Holiday “bonus” funds appear (and vanish) with politics.

## How the Old Survive
- **Family nets:** multigenerational homes; city remittances uneven.
- **Mutual aid:** temple kitchens, neighborhood clubs, Co-Type houses → meals, day-shelter, funeral funds, tiny stipends.
- **Street survival:** “rain sleepers,” stall minders, bottle pickers; elder compounds (widows’ boarding houses) pool stipends.
- **Outcasts & wanderers:** shrine-to-shrine circuits; named city fixtures (“iron-leg by the ferry”).

## Attitudes & Risk
Respect language vs resource rationing; periodic scandals (poorhouse deaths) spark brief crackdowns. Elders are targets for scams; some gangs “adopt” a few for cover.

## Texture
Shrines to **Forgotten Ancestors** at corners; pack-crab lifts for legless veterans; medals paraded on festival days then forgotten.
