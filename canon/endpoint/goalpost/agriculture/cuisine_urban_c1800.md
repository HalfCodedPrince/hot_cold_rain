## Thesis

City eating = **lanes + schedules + stalls**. Mills whiten, warehouses smooth, convoys widen taste. Beneath neon and jungle rain, temple kettles and ward canteens keep the floor from falling out—sometimes barely.

## City staples

Whitened rice & flour; noodle sheets; pulses; greens; reef/estuary fish; oils (coconut, sesame, factory blends, fish); syrups (palm/cane, industrial); pickles and pastes; tinned sweets; off-brand sodas.

## Daily table (by milieu)

* **Dock/works:** scrap pot or starch cake + pickle (AM), stew bowl (PM), fried scraps, sometimes soya gruel or relief biscuit on bad weeks.
* **Clerks/collegia:** tea + sweet ring (AM), noodles/greens + small fish (PM), festival sweets in sets, market soda.
* **Captains/benches:** banquet days with reef fish, young shoots, syrup sweets, tinned fruit; ordinary days echo clerk menus, with more imported goods.

## Vendor repertoire

Steam baskets; wok stalls; skewer pits; syrup-fry tables; seaweed-roll mats; **tea-walkers** with kettles and cups; **soda hawkers** with ice when it holds; neon-lit vendor arcades and night carts; black market fryers and coupon sellers.

## Kitchens & fuel

Brazier stacks with charcoal briquettes; electric stoves buzz when power flows, but most alleys still cook over scavenged wood.
Shared **chimney alleys**; patched cast-iron and enamel pans from treaty ports; blackout candles and battered gas lamps in clerk wards.

## Supply chain & markets

Convoy postings set **arrival windows**, but outages and blackouts cause chaos.
Bonded stores issue **warrants** (sometimes counterfeited); wet markets dawn, dry markets dusk; guild rotations, franchise fights, and black market squatters all claim corners.

## Safety & inspection

**Assay rings** test oils/syrups—when supplies and bribes allow.
Ladle and scoop audits, watered brine fines; **stall-day suspensions** for cheats, but many simply move to another alley or pay the right clerk.
Temple kitchens and aid stations fill gaps after storms, riots, or market fires.

## Festivals & hospitality

Public kettles expand on festival days; **fast-day substitutions** posted; **tide feasts** mesh with lantern nights, radio announcements, and erratic convoy arrivals.

## Taste & status

Polished grains signal income or relief; pepper/clove desserts in richer wards; inland belts prize goat, flatbreads, and imported tins.
Blackouts see even elites eating by lantern, sharing cold rice and market tea.

## Health notes

Notices warn on **polish-only** rations, “market malaise,” and cholera risk.
Temple menus mandate greens/ferments, but supplies run short.
Street **water boilers** cut outbreaks in dense wards, but postwar trauma and malnutrition spikes keep clinics full.
