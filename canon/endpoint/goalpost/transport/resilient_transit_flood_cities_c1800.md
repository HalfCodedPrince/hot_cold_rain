## 1) Water Transit
Ferries, punts, shallow-draft boatways through canals and even streets on flood days. **Backbone mode** when roads fail; quay steps are signed for **storm hours**.

## 2) Cable-Propelled Lines
Gondolas strung ridge-to-ridge or over inlets; storm cutoffs around Beaufort ≥ 8. Stations double as **storm galleries**.

## 3) Funiculars / Inclines
Tie low quays to hill strongholds; manual brake backup for brownouts.

## 4) Floating Platforms (Pilot)
Pontoon streetcar spurs and floating foot piers in calm lagoons only; **maintenance-heavy** and limited to harbors.

## 5) Elevated Walks & Bus Lanes
Raised viaducts connect markets, depots, and galleries; shaded and guttered to shed green-rain slush.

**Intermodal hubs** stitch ferries ↔ trams ↔ cable cars with ticket boards that flip to **storm schedules**.
