## Sea & Inland Water
- **Harbor ferries** (double‑ended), **canal barges** (shallow draft, standardized beam), **pilot boats**.
- Typhoon Protocol Levels **T1–T4** dictate closures; signal masts broadcast flag sets.
- Roll‑on barge ramps double as storm stairs for pedestrians.

## Cable & Grade
- **Aerial cable cars** for cross‑inlets and ridge climbs; wind cutoff at Beaufort ≥ 8.
- **Funiculars** on concrete pylons; counterweight pits above flood; manual brakes for brownouts.
- Stations paired with **storm galleries** (refuge; first‑aid; radio).

## Rail (legacy)
- Great Railway Network (unfinished): inland trunk in fair repair; coastal spurs often washed out.
- Diesel multiple units; short consists; bridge trestles sacrificial and modular for quick swaps.

## Road & Street
- Elevated busways in flood belts; tram track with deck drains; permeable shoulders.
- Wayfinding: hex‑grid house codes; quay markers by tide step numbers.
