## Entities to Mint/Finish

## Timeline TODOs
- **789** — Edict of the Long Beat ✔ (legal unlock for succession)
- **794** — “Marr of the Reeds” pretender event (pamphlet wars) ◻
- **790s** — Convoy Insurance strain set-ups (pre-panic breadcrumbs) ◻
- **800–** — “Golden Cadence” foundations (finance cleanup + theater of unity) ◻

## Cleanup / Consistency
- Standardize *koi/coi* spelling → **Koi-Hi / `LOC:KOI-001`** (rename file + aliases). ◻
- People filenames to lowercase snake_case (e.g., `kelim_ar.md`, `teyu_the_grey.md`). ◻
- Ensure all new IDs appear in Glossary index. ◻
- Link all new systems pages from relevant entities (e.g., Beat Six ↔ Empty Seat; Compositories ↔ Writing & Printing). ◻
