## Supply
- **Rain capture:** roof cisterns, court tanks; temple galleries double as tank farms.
- **River intakes:** sand-bank inlets upstream; vulnerable to flood silt and corpse/pollution loads.
- **Groundwater:** shallow wells on older ridges; brackish creep near coasts.
- **Desal (limited):** small plants for hospitals, naval yards, elite compounds; fuel-dependent.

## Treatment
- **Slow sand & charcoal** in municipal plants; **boil orders** after storms are routine.
- **Private filtration** in rich wards; bulk water vendors for tenements.

## Sewage
- **Combined storm/waste drains** in old cores → regular backflow in green-rain events.
- Newer districts **separate** the systems but suffer illicit tie-ins and maintenance debt.
- **Outfalls** outside city limits foul beaches; septic tanks on periphery; “night soil” routes persist.

## Ops & Failure Modes
- Power dips stall pumps; hill wards go dry first.
- Storm surges invert drains; harbor bans and cholera alerts follow.
- Corruption skims chemicals and pipe stock; audit rolls sticky.

## Street Texture
Masks and squeegee crews scrape **green sludge** into storm slots after pollen rains; kids and scavengers hunt the gutters for dropped coins and jewelry at obvious risk.
