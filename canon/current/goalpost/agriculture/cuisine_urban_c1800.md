## Thesis
City eating = **lanes + schedules + stalls**. Mills whiten, warehouses smooth, convoys widen taste; temple kettles and ward canteens keep the floor from falling out.

## City staples
Whitened rice & flour; noodle sheets; pulses; greens; reef/estuary fish; oils (coconut, sesame, fish); syrups (palm/cane); pickles and pastes.

## Daily table (by milieu)
- **Dock/works:** starch cake + pickle (AM), stew bowl (PM), fried scraps on paydays.  
- **Clerks/collegia:** tea + sweet ring (AM), noodles/greens + small fish (PM), festival sweets in sets.  
- **Captains/benches:** banquet days with reef fish, young shoots, syrup sweets; ordinary days echo clerk menus.

## Vendor repertoire
Steam baskets; wok stalls; skewer pits; syrup-fry tables; seaweed-roll mats; **tea-walkers** with kettles and cups.

## Kitchens & fuel
Brazier stacks with charcoal briquettes; shared **chimney alleys**; cast-iron spreads from treaty ports; enamel kettles in clerk wards.

## Supply chain & markets
Convoy postings set **arrival windows**; bonded stores issue **warrants**; wet markets dawn, dry markets dusk; guild rotations for corner rights.

## Safety & inspection
**Assay rings** test oils/syrups; ladle and scoop audits; watered brine fines; **stall-day suspensions** for repeat cheats.

## Festivals & hospitality
Public kettles expand; **fast-day substitutions** posted; **tide feasts** mesh with lantern nights and convoy arrivals.

## Taste & status
Polished grains signal income; pepper/clove desserts in richer wards; inland belts prize goat and flatbreads.

## Health notes
Notices warn on **polish-only** rations; temple menus mandate greens/ferments; street **water boilers** reduce outbreaks.
