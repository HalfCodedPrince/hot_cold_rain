## Modes & Reality
- **River & barge:** slow, predictable, cheap; backbone for staples and ore.
- **Rail (legacy):** inland trunk serviceable; coastal spurs patchy; trestles modular.
- **Sea convoys:** capacity king but weather/piracy risk; escorts rationed by premium.
- **Air freight:** rare, tiny, **expensive**; storm cancellations routine; prestige routes only.
- **Smuggling:** fills import gaps (pharma, spares, luxuries); “gray” networks overlap temple relief and veteran syndicates.

## Price Wedges
Insurance, bribes, and storm delays widen city-to-city spreads; festival cycles and green-rain algae blooms whipsaw perishables.

## Institutions
Debt Office paper funds beacons/dredge cycles; insurers post daily rates on **Insurance Steps**; Harbor Watches certify hours for claims.
