## Thesis
Seasonal **green rains**, warm coasts, and flood cycles define the burden of disease; infrastructure plus simple protocols keep cities livable.

## Risks
- Waterborne: cholera-like, leptospirosis; vector fevers (dengue-like); post-flood fungal lungs.  
- Pollen/aerosol surges; episodic toxic blooms (historic spit grass).

## Infrastructure
- **Slow-sand + chlorination** plants; elevated cisterns; blue-tag potable taps.  
- **Storm clinics** at tram/cable hubs; temple infirmaries for mass care. 

## Protocols
- Green-Rain advisories (Lv. 1â€“3): masks/veils, roof-wash, boil notices; vaccine schedules posted in parish song spaces. 

## Rehabilitation
- Post-war prosthetics (shell-laminate, cane exosplints); trauma clinics.
