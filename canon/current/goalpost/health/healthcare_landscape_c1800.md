## Public & State
- **Hospitals:** grand, battered “Imperial” centers + district clinics; many ex-military.
- **Veterans’ homes:** amputees, burns, **storm-mind** (shell shock) wards.
- **Epidemiology institutes:** comparatively strong; field teams track cholera/dengue/flu and **pollen lung**.

**Staffing:** mixed gender; military-trained medics; pharmacist culture vital; burnout endemic.

**Facilities:** triage halls; prosthetics shops (iron legs, articulated hands, burn masks); mobile canvas clinics for floods and outbreaks.

**Surveillance:** posters and bell alerts for **boil orders**, quarantine stripes on doors; festival-cycle vaccine drives.

## Private & Religious
- **Private clinics:** best kit, imported drugs, lower crowding.
- **Temple healers (Good Old Rhythm):** sanatoria + music therapy; herbal formularies; licensed by House Five.

## Underground & Alternatives
- **Shadow clinics:** ex-army surgeons, unlicensed midwives; no-questions records.
- **Prosthetics backrooms:** bespoke wood/metal limbs from salvage.
- **“Rain Healers”:** treat rare green-rain syndromes (mix of real and quack).
- **Street remedies & psychics:** tonics, prayers, séances—desperation markets.

*Co-Type practices survive inside communities (e.g., bat “listening therapy”), often blending into mainstream care when effective.*
