# Piracy, Convoys & Navies

## Thesis
Bright-Sea commerce survives by **convoy habit**, **watch networks**, and **prize law**. Weather windows and ash-years swing risk; “navy” mostly means **escorts + forts + insurance** (not blue-water empires). 

## Threat model
- **Fast skiffs** from island arcs; board at **dusk/dawn**; crooked minor ports grease the chain.  
- **Widiwidi lee coves**; **ash years** spike attacks and blind shore posts. 

## Institutions / actors
- **Harbor Watches**: bells, fog posts, headland signal huts, radio triangles.  
- **Escort letters** (letters of marque) under city law; **black-hull “Q-boats”** as decoys.  
- **Prize Courts** (Diet/Temple mixed panels); **Too-Kahet banks** enforce routed-plan filings for cover. 

## Practices & law
- **Convoys** = tug + barge strings + pickets; flags/whistles standard; radio for landfall fixes.  
- **Salvage shares**, **bottomry loans**, and **convoy pools** shift risk from skippers to paper. See also currency & insurance instruments.

## Economics / logistics
- Closures and reroutes mean **feast/famine price cycles**; tariff relief often trades against convoy dues. 

## Risks / failure modes
- Corrupt minor ports; **schedule drift** during lean treasury seasons; “licensed” escorts shake down neutrals.  
- Radio triangles degrade in ash storms; Q-boat misuse leads to scandal and tighter prize rules.
