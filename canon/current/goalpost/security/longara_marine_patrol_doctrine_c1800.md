# Thesis
Longara’s Marine Patrol fights small-boat piracy in a shallow, storm-broken, archipelago sea with **oar-and-sail craft** backed by **beacon/watcher networks**. Presence is gridded at reef passes and channel mouths; intercepts are **cue-driven** (watch bells, blue-paper premium spikes, convoy calls) rather than wide-area sweeps. The doctrine assumes **scarce fuel**, **unreliable engines**, and frequent **green-rain standdowns**—so **oars first**, **sail second**, **motor last**.

# Operating Environment
- **Sea & weather.** Mangroves, shoals, reef shelves, and narrow guts; typhoon corridors and pollen “green rains” that cut visibility and foul lungs/metal. After storms, wreck-picking and opportunistic raids surge (harbor courts/insurers post emergency notices).  
- **Flow.** The Old Song sets practical lanes and lee anchorages; patrol stations sit where the set converges on reef cuts, ferry steps, and beacon chains.  
- **Signals.** Harbor Watches (bells, flags, lantern codes) and beacon legs form the early-warning and certification mesh that patrols ride.  

# Missions & Authorities
1) **Interdict piracy/smuggling** in reef cuts, mangrove canals, ferry steps.  
2) **Certify convoys** and shepherd stragglers onto lit legs when “broken chain” outages hit.  
3) **Board & inspect** unlicensed privateers (“cloak-men”), contraband carriers, and false-flag fishers.  
4) **Storm-edge security**: hold shelves, disperse looters, mark wreck sites for claims/insurers.  
5) **Aid to Works & Watches**: move tenders, reset channel marks, tow disabled lighters.

_Primary papers_: ward captain’s commission; convoy dockets; letters-of-marque registers; watch circulars (“blue papers” for premium surges); bench-dockets for fines/seizures.

# Patterns of Presence
- **Choke-point lattice.** Permanent posts at: (a) outer reef cuts to the deep, (b) canal mouths behind mangroves, (c) ferry stairs between island villages and market quays.  
- **Two-bell loiter.** Patrols sit under beacons/watcher huts on storm eves and at festival tides; rotate every two bells to keep oars fresh.  
- **Shelf-hold doctrine.** Keep the fight on fortified shelf and in foul edges: force raiders to close against current and spray; avoid blue-water chases.  
- **Cue-driven surges.** When blue papers post or a leg goes dark, detach two cutters to likely ambush shelves; the rest shadow convoys.

# Platforms & Fitouts (typical 1780–1795)
**A. Mangrove Skiff (“mud-swim”)**  
- 6–9 m flat-bottom punt; draft 0.3–0.5 m; 4–6 rowers + cox; scull yoke.  
- Fit: one bow swivel (light snub gun) with grape or case; boarding hooks; throw-nets.  
- Use: silent night work in canals, stake-out mangrove mouths, tag-and-shadow.

**B. Reef Cutter (galley-cutter hybrid)**  
- 12–16 m; double-banked 10–14 oars; single lateen/crab-claw; draft ~0.8–1.0 m.  
- Fit: 2 swivels on beam pintles; 1 short carronade amidships (when available); dye pots (reef-dye charges) to mark fleeing hulls; line-gun for grapnels; hand pumps; storm anchor.  
- Use: main intercept boat at reef cuts; “push-of-oar” chases down lee lanes.

**C. Typhoon Sloop (upcycled convoy escort)**  
- 18–22 m, shallow keel; reefable fore-and-aft; draft ~1.4 m; crew 12–18.  
- Fit: 2 short-bore carronades on breeching; 2–4 swivels; stretcher rack; spare marks/lanterns for emergency leg relight.  
- Use: weather picket; convoy shepherd on exposed runs; platform for skiff pair.

**D. Beacon Tender (Works loaner)**  
- Slow, bluff-bowed service hull; loads posts, lantern oil, spare plates; carries a squad and one swivel.  
- Use: logistics spine for a ward; storm repair & mark resets.

_Small arms_: shot-carbines, riot fowling pieces, revolvers; rain skins; gutter-pans and touch guards kept as habits even on fixed cartridges. Boarding kit favors hooks, poles, and nets over sabers (to keep prisoners and cargo intact).

# Tactics
- **Shadow & Sting.** Skiff tags suspect lighters at dusk; cutters hold silent behind reef ribs; sloop blocks the outs; board at tide-turn when oars beat sails.  
- **False-lantern draw.** With the Watch, mimic a misaligned leg to pull raiders into a prepared shelf; switch to bell code to close the net.  
- **Net & Dye.** Throw-nets to foul oars; dye-pots slap onto planks—stains identify boats at daylight courts.  
- **Storm-edge rush.** One cutter rides the feeder canal where looters emerge post-gale; sloop sits off the only safe bar crossing.  
- **Board prudence.** Fire once for shock; close fast; keep powder and hands dry; seize tillers and oars first; talk in tariff/court language to motivate surrender.

# Crew, Training & Morale
- Crews recruit from fisher lines and lightermen; tight-knit oar benches matter more than ranks.  
- Drills: silent shipping of oars, mangrove pole-work, bell/flag codes, night conning by smell/sound along the Old Song set.  
- Corruption pressure lives at the interface with convoy tickets and seizure courts; rotation between wards reduces “customary fees.”

# Logistics & Maintenance
- **Fuel-poor doctrine.** Engines (when fitted) are for typhoon egress and medical runs; planning assumes oars.  
- **Spares are scrounged.** Works tenders carry shared lockers: lantern chimneys, pintle pins, pump leather, breeching line.  
- **Pay & paper.** Meal-ticket scrip in scarcity; small prize cuts for legal seizures; blue-paper days bring overtime but also audits.

# Weather & Green-Rain Protocol
- Mask, veil, and cape standard; red/other bright scarves serve as quick face seals in light events.  
- Powder and mechanisms are bagged; firing arcs are limited upwind during pollen events.  
- Typhoon posture: pull hulls behind mangrove lee, strike spars, double on breechings, leave a skiff at each gut for after-blow looters.

# Adversaries (typical)
- **Reef crews.** 12–30 hands in outriggers or fish-rowers; scavenge/raid unescorted barges; hide in mangrove creeks; carry two snub guns and many fowling pieces.  
- **Cloak-men.** Unlicensed “privateers” with forged marque leafs; prefer intimidation and paper games over fights.  
- **Wreck pickers.** First on-scene post-storm; will mob unless a shelf is held early.

# Failure Modes / Risks
- Beacon outages (“broken chain”) cascade convoy stragglers into ambush shelves.  
- Green-rain season cuts visibility and fouls metal; misfires rise; courts later overturn rough seizures.  
- Ward collusion (Watches × insurers × Works) can steer patrols away from “friends” unless audited.

# Hooks (for 1788–1793 character work)
- A **blue-paper week** spikes premiums; Adan’s crew is ordered to stage a false-lantern draw at a notorious reef rib.  
- A **storm-edge rush**: skiff crew rides smell and sound when all lanterns are out; the only “light” is Hex-halo green on spray.  
- A **cloak-man hearing**: the seized boat waves a dubious marque; Adan is told to “lose” the docket copy between quay and clerk.

# Cross-refs
- Bright Sea climate & storm culture; Old Song lanes; beacons/works; watches/insurers; ships (oar galleys); letters of marque; rain gear; arms.
