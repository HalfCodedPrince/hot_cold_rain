## Overview
Post–Last War consumer TV reboots on a **low-power, patchwork grid**. To keep legacy black-and-white sets alive while rolling out color, the civil boards adopt a **compatible subcarrier** system (color info piggybacks on B/W luminance).

### The Signal (engineer sketch)
- **Luma (Y):** baseband luminance (what B/W sets decode).
- **Chroma (U/V):** two quadrature subcarriers tucked between luma detail (“interleaved dot pattern” on close inspection).
- **Line/field timing:** harmonized to the **Hex beat flicker** to reduce moiré under lantern light.
- **Bandwidth:** narrow—prefers **desaturated** colors; heavy greens suppress to avoid green-rain glare.

### Why this standard wins
- **Backwards-compatible**: millions of B/W sets still work.
- **Low power tolerant**: holds sync during brownouts; color simply desaturates first.
- **Repairable**: discrete component designs; kit shops build decoder boards from surplus.

## Studio & Camera Practice
- **Tri-filter camera heads** (split-prism) → two-tube economy units become common; full three-tube rigs in capitals only.
- **Skin tones** biased warm; **greens** deliberately desaturated to avoid “rain cast.”
- **Wardrobe** rules: no tight herringbones or high-saturation greens; matte makeup for sweat.

## Receiver Reality
- **Tri-dot shadow-mask CRTs** rare; most sets are **single-tube** with a color-decoder and coarse dot mask.
- **Service menus**: hue/phase dials drift with heat; viewers “tune faces” at the start of broadcasts.
- **Power brownouts**: sets switch to **Y-only** (B/W) gracefully; chroma decoder mutes to avoid smearing.

## Rollout Politics
- **Temple education** broadcasts get early color to drive buy-in.
- **Insurance Steps** sponsor weather lanes + hazard alerts: color maps on peak hours only.
- Rural relays use **low-height masts**; pirate repeaters appear on festival days.

### Notes for writers
- Color that “breathes” with power.
- On green-rain days, telecasts look **strangely neutral**; rumor: “the city mutes the green.”
