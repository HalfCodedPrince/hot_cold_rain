## Constraints
- **Structure:** reinforced concrete present but costly; steel frames rare.
- **Services:** pumps/elevators unreliable → practical ceiling **4–6 stories**.
- **Storms:** sacrificial ground floors; raised walkways; flood marks on plaster.

## Typical Fabrics
- **Old districts:** 2–4 stories, shopfronts below, flats above; tight alleys; stairwells as social space.
- **Midrises:** 5–7 stories; walk-ups or a grudging lift; public housing and clerk belts.
- **Panels on the edge:** 5–9 stories modular; refugees and resettlement wards.
- **Prestige cores:** 10–15 story towers (hotel/state stacks) with backup water/power.

## Density Habits
Rooftops = gardens, laundry, sleeping in heatwaves. Markets and tram depots anchor plazas. Cities sprawl along high ground, cable lines, and rail grades.

## After Green Rain
Upper stories bloom with music and drying cloth; crews sluice streets; temple kitchens open flood-soup lines.
