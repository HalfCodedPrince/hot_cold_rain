## Sources (patchwork)
- **Diesel** gensets: ubiquitous, noisy, dirty; keep docks & clinics alive.
- **Hydropower:** interior rivers; small weirs & wheels in old quarters.
- **Coal/heavy oil:** pocket basins; base load where fuel exists.
- **Solar/wind:** spotty in modern wards; storm maintenance costly.
- **Microgrids:** rich cores & civic sites (hospitals, beacons) mix solar/wind + diesel backup.
- **Imports:** fuels are expensive and jittery.

## Transmission
Salt air + wind = failure. **Buried cable** in rich/government zones; elsewhere **sagging overheads** and rolling blackouts. Lightning rods on every big roof.

## Culture of Repair
Neighborhood substation as landmark; a known **generator man/woman** patches life back together after each storm.

## Precautions
Scarce surge protection; pre-typhoon posters warn against downed lines; temple bells carry blackout advisories.
