> **Matter:** bundled petitions re: convoy relief column cut at **Pine-Pass Shelf**; claims for beasts, carts, barges, and persons; counter-petitions re: dereliction.

### Parties & filings
- **Petitioners:** grain-note factors (6), barge runners (3), ward carters (11), widows (8).
- **Respondents:** Ward Captain, Salt-Fork; two Captain-Reps (names redacted); three marque crews (“ticket-men”).
- **Joined in interest (informal):** Harbor Watches, Bell Three–Five.

### Facts found (from sworn statements & bells log)
1) **Beacon Leg Six dark** two cycles prior; **errata leaf** warning posted but not counter-signed.  
2) Relief column mustered **at 61% strength**; guides hired on fee; **oath delayed** (Beat Six clerk absent).  
3) **Fog & sleet** at third bell; column halted on **Pine-Pass Shelf**; rear carts bunched.  
4) **Pass confederates** pressed from spruce line; javelins at first rush; mule tail cut; guide **defection** observed.  
5) Nightfall: quicklime cups flung; shell shields held line; **two barge ferries lashed** as a floating redoubt off the ford.  
6) **Ticket-men** arrived predawn; demanded prize share for “rescue” under marque; refused to advance without tally.

### Loss & tally (partial)
- Beasts: 37 head (mule/ox), carts: 19, grain drums: 42; persons: 13 unreturned at roll.  
- Two **marque pennants singed**; three widows sworn; four lads maimed (sling hand, eye, knee, lung).

### Findings
- Muster order **lawful**; execution **negligent** (oaths & relief timing).  
- Guides’ oath **not taken** → court refuses “treachery” writ; awards only **fee-forfeit**.  
- **Ticket-men**: no prize right on **land seizures** absent Council annex; counted as **escort hire** for one bell only.

### Orders
- Ward Captain to **pay meal-tickets** at famine rate for 30 days; barge runners to be made whole in rope & pitch.  
- Captain-Reps **admonished**; next relief to **hold shelf** and wait foul-weather egress; no pursuit beyond bell three.  
- Clerk to paste this extract to **claim-stairs** and to ring **three-three-one** upon crowding.

_Notes in margin (hand of Clerk Per.):_ “Errata to pilots a day late is **no errata**. Get the bellman to sign blue next time.”
