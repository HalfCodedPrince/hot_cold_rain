#Chapter 1: The Solar Song and Its Dancers
Did you know our world, Point, is not alone? We spin and twirl through space with many companions, all dancing to the bright music of Oboe - the warm, golden light at the center of our solar song! Let’s meet them all…

Oboe – The Sun That Sings
Oboe is our sun. It’s a yellow dwarf star, which means it’s big, bright, and steady - just right for life! Oboe’s warm light keeps us from freezing and helps plants and animals grow. Some people say Oboe sings a silent song that only the bravest explorers (and best musicians!) can hear in their dreams.

A snack on the way home: Bean
Between Point and Oboe is a tiny, chilly world named Bean. It was discovered long ago by a Widiwidi astronomer, E. K. Fori, who was apparently enjoying a late-night snack of rice and beans when spotting it - hence the name!
Bean is a dwarf planet - too small to be a real planet, but visible enough to be named. It is too hot on one side and too cold on the other, so nobody lives there, but it sometimes peeks out at us before dawn.

Point – Our Home World
We live on Point! That’s us! It’s round, blue, and green, with big seas and three huge continents: Ord, Sar, and Widiwidi. We have jungles, mountains, storms, and all kinds of people and creatures.
But what makes Point truly special is its big, beautiful moon…

Hex – Our moon
Point’s only moon is called Hex. It’s huge - bigger even than Bean, who is almost a planet! But what’s even more amazing is that, on some nights, Ex shines with a soft green light, or even glows jade-bright.
Why is Hex green? Well, our air is often full of tiny bits of pollen and dust, especially after the green rains. When moonlight passes through this haze, the colors bend, and Hex can turn green, just like a sunset can turn red or orange.
People used to believe Hex was watching them at night, turning green with envy and throwing big stormy tantrums - all to get back at people!

Karodot’s Tears – The Asteroid Belt
Between Point and the next planet, there’s a swirling ring of rocky bits called Karodot’s Tears. They’re leftovers from long ago - a place where a planet almost formed, but didn’t, because Karodot wouldn’t allow it! Sometimes, pieces of Karodot’s Tears fall to Point as shooting stars.
The name comes from an old legend: Karodot, a beautiful sea-goddess, wept for a sailor who left her and her daughters for the sea, and as ice spread over her heart, so to her tears froze into stones, forever circling the sky.

Karodot – The Old Hag of the Sea
Karodot is a giant planet, much bigger than Point. From here, she looks like a bright blue star, sometimes easy to find, sometimes gone for weeks - just like a moody sea goddess people believed her to be.
Karodot has a thin, ghostly ring (which you can sometimes see if you’re lucky!), and many moons - her “daughters.” The largest, Sere-Karodot, was believed to be the kindest and the fairest of them all. 
Did you know? Some sailors still claim Karodot’s moods stir the seas. This, of course, is very silly. If you hear your old grandpa saying it, remind him that none but the Rhythm is divine, young stargazer!

Ze and the Trailing Belt
Far beyond Karodot lives another small world, Ze - a “dwarf planet”, like Bean, lonely and icy amid the blackness of space, discovered not long ago by clever sky-watchers with big telescopes.
And past Ze is the Trailing Belt - a frozen sea of distant, tiny worlds, too far away to see without special tools. Who knows what secrets they hold?

Point’s Tilt and Seasons: Why is it raining, why is it dry?
You know that Point has temperamental seasons - one moment it’s dry; the next, torrential rain. That’s because our world is tilted a bit, like a spinning top leaning to the side.
As Point circles Oboe, sometimes the north leans closer to the sun, then the south. This shifts where sunlight falls and sends the weather into a dance. Plus, Hex pulls on our tides and clouds, making rainstorms stronger and more sudden.
Because of the tilt, our rainy and dry seasons can arrive in mere hours. Always keep your eyes to the sky, and start each day with the hymn to Oboe! 

#SIDEBAR: How to Read the Sky for Signs of Weather
Old porters and fishermen say the sky tells stories - if you know how to listen! Here are some secrets:
Clouds and Their Tales
Thin, high clouds (like brushstrokes): Often mean the weather will stay calm for a while.
Big, puffy clouds growing taller: A storm might be coming, especially if they turn dark at the bottom.
Greenish clouds at sunrise or sunset: Watch out! That’s pollen and rain mixing - green rain may be on the way.
What the Moon Says
Bright, clear Hex: Weather usually stays the same.
A ring around Hex (“the Queen’s Halo”): Rain in a day or two.
Winds and Smells
Sudden, strong gusts: Big storm or “Song change” may come soon. Be sure to find cover somewhere elevated, or come to the nearest Song Space - Oboe’s own take care of each other!
If the air smells sweet and earthy in the morning: Rain is likely before nightfall.
Birds and Bugs
Seabirds flying inland: A storm is coming from the sea.
If the city’s night-bugs are silent: Some say a downpour is coming.
Old Saying to Remember:
“Green moon, green rain -
My mouth I cover to breathe again!”
With practice, you’ll be reading the sky like an old sea captain. Remember, weather changes fast on Point - so always check the sky before you go! Praise the Song!

A Sky Full of Stories
Next time you look up at Oboe’s shining face, or see Hex glow green, or catch Karodot’s blue spark, remember—you are part of a grand, spinning song that stretches across ages and oceans.
Praise the Song!
