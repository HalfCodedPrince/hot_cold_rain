"The ancient, the submerged, the misrepresented: history of Cuzhar Krum
Introduction: before the Oboe’s songs
When we consider the distant origins of our civilizations, we must first imagine a world both familiar and strange. Tens of thousands of years ago, on the southern continent of Sar, our earliest human ancestors learned to thrive amid shifting river valleys, dense forests, and abundant coastal estuaries. Here, in the humid cradle of the south, small communities fished, foraged, and - eventually - tamed the first crops that would support urban life.
It is on Sar that the earliest traces of agriculture and village life are found: simple stone tools, fishhooks, woven nets, and the enigmatic shell middens that line ancient waterways. These communities gradually spread outward - some eastward by raft and canoe, others north along river corridor - giving rise to the first network of human cultures across Point.
Roughly a thousand years before the founding of Ord, a remarkable civilization flourished among the isles of the Bright Sea. The people of Cuzhar Krum - impressed upon modern culture with the images of their titanic, half submerged labyrinthian ziggurats - dominated maritime trade, developing a unique written script and elaborate rituals that blended sun and sea worship into a system of belief still echoing today in the most unexpected of places.
Krumian scribes recorded their laws, treaties, and transaction on the sun-baked clay, with the poetry and art relegated to the prized shells of their domesticated pack crabs - rare relics now, but once the contract and currency of high society. Krumain cities and streets, half-swallowed by the sea, can still be glimpsed as moss-covered silhouettes above and below the waterline, inhabited now by schools of fish and green photic moss.
Yet the Krumian world was a delicate balance, dependent on regular trade for its goods and metals - especially tin, imported from the distant mountain ranges in Ord. When a sequence of volcanic eruptions darkened the skies and sent weather into chaos, Krumian cities faltered, their fleet scattered and sunk on the now raging currents of the Old Song. The lifeline snapped. Famine and migration followed; the isles emptied, leaving only the ruins we know today and the “Land People” of legend, who would become scapegoats and cultural touchstones even outside the historic literature, their image brought to life by the works of the late M. Homun-An. 
Cuzhar Krum, however, wasn’t the only civilization to blossom. Contemporary to it, the lush river valleys and jungles of Sar saw the rise of their own cities - rich, flamboyant societies built on rice paddies and fishponds, thriving for centuries before a devastating crop disease swept the region. This sudden blight - whose exact reasons and details are contested to this day - triggered a slow, terrible unraveling. The urban centers emptied, ceremonial complexes fell silent, and dense jungle reclaimed the fields and canals.
Archaeologists today still debate the fate of these “Moss cities” - whether their peoples were absorbed by newcomers, dispersed into the hills, or simply faded away, leaving behind intricate earthworks and enigmatic statues.
The first Blindness
The collapse of these early polities ushered in centuries of fragmentation. Despite the poetic name, given it by Homun-An, it would be more correctly call this period a “little ice age” - a time of climate fluctuation, shifting river courses and temporary silencing of the Old Song’s current. Writing vanished in most regions; oral tradition, myth, and folk ritual preserved and mutated fragments of the Krumian legacy, until existence of the Cuzhar Krum itself was relegated to no more than a myth from an age before men and waters were created. 
It would take many generations before new city-states emerged, first on the riverbanks and estuaries of Ord, and later across the known world.
Why Does This Matter?
Though little survives from these earliest eras but ruins, shards, and muddied relfections, their influence endures. Us counting minutes and hours in 60's, the open-air rituals of sun and sea, and even the music of the Good Old Rhythm bear the imprint of Krum, and, in some surprising way, even her lost contemporaries. 
This work is aimed at those who wish to know the difference between myth and legend, between pop-culture stereotype and the historical fact. Hence, we invite the reader to delve with us into the history and wonders of the ancient Cuzhar Krum.
