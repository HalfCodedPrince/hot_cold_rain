**ERRATA for Ridge Crossing, springs 1203 AO**

- **Set sings late by half-bell** after green squalls; hold the outer bar **two oar-lengths wider** than chart.  
- **Karodot glow** seen low in haze: ignore. It is not the ridge.

_Marginal hand (navigator T.):_ “Two legs dark this week. If Hex shows a green veil, lash children and pots **below**. Slingmen to foredeck — you’ll hear the ridge before you see it.”

_Marginal hand (clerk):_ “Report pennant quarrels to Steps; no claims heard without board number painted on the mizzen.”
