**To all ward houses and bell posts:**

1) **Blue Papers** are to be posted only on the **claim-stairs** by a clerk bearing a tin badge and docket string. Anyone else pinning blue slips is to be seized and walked to Steps.

2) In weeks of **Broken Chain** (two or more legs dark), **escort bargaining** shall be held at the quay rope below the bell, not in ale rooms. A Watch sergeant will hold the tally board.

3) **Marque boats** are to keep their pennants visible even at night; lantern codes: short-short-long means “escorting,” long-long-short means “seeking hire.”

4) In any riot at the Steps: bells three-three-one. Clubs, not hooks. No fires near the docket boards.

By order of the Ward Captain; signed and dipped in the brine.
