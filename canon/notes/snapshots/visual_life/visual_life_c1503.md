> Street-level textures on the **morning-of** the Day of Green Skies (pre-mutation). Use with the era file for politics and heat; this file tracks **what the eye/ear meets**.

## Light & Weather Palette
- **Tint:** low green cast under overcast; gutters already fitted with **pollen traps**; laundry lines strung under eaves instead of open courtyards.  
- **Surfaces:** salt-crusted paint reads matte; **beacon bands** show two shades darker where lacquer resists stains.  
- **Air:** boiled grain + fish oil + damp wood. Temple-advisory placards pinned at ward shrines (“rinse times,” **roof-walk cautions**).

## Street Signs & Paper
- **Access Day boards**: sliding slats with festival glyphs; chalk **ratings** wiped and redrawn between patrols.  
- **Blue papers**: stiff courier sheets sealed with plate-stamps; runners tuck them flat under oilcloth in chest-wraps.  
- **Errata pasting**: boys with paste-pots cover last night’s lampoons with rebuttal slips while a watch beadle “doesn’t see.”

## Clothing Drift (work to watch)
- **Work tunics** under **storm aprons**; hems weighted; knees patched with waxed duck.  
- **Half-capes** for ward authority; lacquered badges to hide rust; **shell scales** strapped over dyed coats for beadles on dock duty.  
- **Festival wear** muted: reed-lamé belts rolled and pocketed; stage masks carried in coarse bags rather than hung at stalls.  
- **Headcloths** double as pollen veils; children with **tinted eye-cords** on windy lanes.

## Objects That Read (1503 set)
- **Claim ladders** beside Steps: rungs nicked by knife proofs; three petitions pinned, one torn off, one re-pinned sideways.  
- **Portable shrines** lashed to ferry roofs; coin slots clogged with salt and green grit.  
- **Plate frames** stacked behind shop shutters; top one shows a satyr’s open mouth scrubbed to blank.  
- **Aux beacons**: rooftop cans hand-painted moss-dark; two legs lit, one canted.

## Soundscape
- **Meter-in-law**: hand-sign clicks at crossings; the call “short-short-long” for lane clearances.  
- **Printing rooms**: Seven-Frame clack beneath street din; someone counts off proofs over the hiss of kettle glue.  
- **Rites**: shell horns from side courtyards; chorus rehearsal leaks through temple-conservatory shutters.  
- **Playhouses**: drum cues clipped; a satyr troupe rehearses behind a barge curtain, lines half-sung to avoid fines.

## Food & Market Lines
- **Fish-thin mornings**: stewpots carry more beans; oyster stalls post “quiet knives” signs to soothe the ward.  
- **Greens** damp-wrapped in reed paper; vinegar jars corked with cloth wads; itinerant bakers scratch **bread marks** on door lintels for standing orders.  
- **Refugee trays**: pickled roots, fried millet patties, and sweet-water tea—cheap and hot at quay corners.

## Motion & Logistics
- **Convoy pennants** hang slack; escort luggers bargain by whistle from beyond the boom.  
- **Handcarts** ferry lamp oil to legs unlikely to light; porters in single-file with **spill ropes**.  
- **Packet alleys** kept swept; **hold-and-search** posts show plate-check forms pinned under oilskin.

## Print, Stage & Street (pamphlet choreography)
- **Bundle stalls**: rebuttal leaf tucked into festival programs as “safety chorus.”  
- **Seizure kits**: watch crates with twine, sealing wax, and a plate-sleeve; fines posted in neat numerals on a chalk slate.  
- **Satyr fines** stand in for brands in Free Cities; in Ord-facing wards, **sackings** leave broken mask frames in gutters.

## Rites & Policing (face of the Rhythm)
- **Steps**: clerks chalk rate boards, then palm them clean; beadles tap **hand-counts** into soup lines at shrine yards.  
- **Deafening** now mostly symbolic—an empty chair and folded veil set in the portico to remind, not to use.  
- **Green advisories** read aloud by a temple singer while a cousin posts the same in neat, smaller script below.

## Refugee Enclaves (street tells)
- **Splendid Word** corners near lotus baths: loaned fonts drying on racks; hymn-cards in mixed hands.  
- **Knees reed-houses** in quay wards: damp mats hung under eaves; a reed-dance drum wrapped against rain, roped to a bench.  
- **Co-Type** rooms near southern depots: double doors with mismatched locks; **company court** notices pasted in two scripts.

## Five Quick Vignettes (ward-to-ward)
1) **Ord, Benchside lane, dawn** — Gutter screens stacked by the shrine; a printer’s boy pastes errata over last night’s lampoon; a conservatory alto warms on a hum while beadles measure the soup line with finger taps.  
2) **Tau-Hi delta, festival–2** — Convoy clerk rubs a chalk star off an Access board; barge troupe mouths their satyr lines in mime; a Sea-Lotus bursar quietly buys two bundles of rebuttals.  
3) **Free City quay, midday** — Satyr fines posted like playbills; a mercenary sergeant cools his match; a stall-keeper pockets his mask ribbon as the watch strolls by.  
4) **Knees ward, dusk** — Procession shoes leave petal smears; a reed-vision singer faces a closed playhouse door, humming the cadence alone.  
5) **Kllrian upland market, overcast** — Terrace scholars buy rain veils without trying prices; a Stone Room porter carries a crate of bound plates wrapped in plain brown.

## Thresholds & Interiors
- **Doorframes** chalked with convoy stop-marks; lintel **bread marks** for family rations.  
- **Shop backs**: proof-sheets pegged above the kettle; one sheet stitched with red gut where a line was cut last night.  
- **Hall tables**: tinned plates, a single oil lamp, folded veil, **pollen comb**; shoes left toe-out for quick rites.

## Watch Kit (dock issue, morning check)
- **Half-cape**, lacquer badge, cord whistle; **spill rope**; short hook; oiled match in horn; a fine slate and chalk.  
- **Form sleeves** with plate-seal pockets; **neutral wax** for non-theater closures; a spare ribbon for confiscated masks.

## Children & Games
- **Errata tag**: two teams paste over each other’s street chalk; points for clean edges.  
- **Beacon legs** sketched on paving stones; hop counts map to **aux patterns**.  
- **Hand-signs** copied in play—“short–short–long”—then straightened when a beadle rounds the corner.

## Visual Grammar (what’s new vs 1200)
- **More paper, closer to the eye**; prints live on bodies (pinned leafs, belt-folds) as much as on walls.  
- **Green-management** rituals routine (veils, traps, rinse-times).  
- **Authority** reads as **performative**: the same board chalked twice in a morning, the same fine paid as theater.

### Artist’s Notes / Staging Prompts
- Keep **matte greens** and **lacquer blacks** in the same frame; show **chalk erased** rather than chalk written.  
- Let **water** do story-work: puddle reflections of pennants; gutter traps full; roof-walkers in silhouette.  
- Show **paper layers**: pasting over, palimpsest, torn corners; reveal a **rebuttal slip** peeking out of a festival program.
