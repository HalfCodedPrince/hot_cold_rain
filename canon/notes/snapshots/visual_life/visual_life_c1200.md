## Street view â€” Ord Bay ward, overcast afternoon
**Quays:** beacon bands flake; two legs dark; pilots trade **errata leafs** at lantern stalls. Watch capes are patched darker; badges lacquered to hide rust. :
**Steps:** rate boards chalked, then palmed clean; a clerk pins a **blue paper** (emergency premium) with a wax bit; crowd reads, mutters, disperses.  
**Alleys:** Seven-Frame clack from basement doors; damp proof-leafs hung with clotheslines. 

_Smell & sound:_ stale indigo, lamp oil, hot rain on iron, mildew in rope; cut-off beacons moan; Watch whistles run short/short/long.  
_Color:_ tarred blacks, faded reed-green, salt-bitten ochre; the sudden white of a fresh claim docket.

## Clothing drift
- Work tunics over **storm aprons**; quick-drain hems mended with darker panels; veils more common on pollen days. (Clothing system for baselines.)
- Watch & militia: mixed issue; shell scales over dyed civilian coats; **half-capes** signal ward authority. 

## Objects that read
- **Broken Chain**: a line of leg housings with two dark, one canted; hand-painted **aux beacons** on rooftops.  
- **Claim ladders**: wooden rails beside Steps where clerks post appeals; rungs nicked by knives.  
- **Portable shrines**: Rhythm boxes lashed to ferry roofs; coin slots choked with salt.

## Motion & logistics
- Evening ferries stack three deep; **escort luggers** idle off the boom, bargaining for a last-minute contract.  
- Handcarts ferry drums of lamp oil to legs that may not light; barge runners carry **blue papers** upriver.

## Festival residue
- Hexennial banners left up a beat too long; choir sashes repurposed as armbands for soup lines.
