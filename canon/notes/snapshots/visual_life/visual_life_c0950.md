## Street view — Ord City, a workday (sketch)
**Dawn** — Fog off the bay. Beacon legs fade to amber. Harbor bells and hand-drums walk the quays; watch capes are waxed, not shiny. Ink boys shoulder bundles toward Compository Row.  
**Midday** — Slipways and cranes creak; lime-waxed fittings flash dull white; convoy boards chalk premiums on the Insurance Steps.  
**Night** — Lantern rows throw mustard light; choir practice leaks from side chapels; patrol whistles trade short/long codes between piers.

_Smell & sound palette:_ resin, warm fish, hot wax, wet rope; fog bells, coded drums, clack of wood sandals, type-frames thunking in compositories.  
_Color palette:_ indigo work-dye, reed-green trim, clay-ochre plasters, tar-black rails; white chalk on tariff stones.  
(See apex baseline for governance/finance rhythms.)  
``Matters later: cartel entanglements between Watches × Insurance × Works become public scandals.`` 

## Clothing (civic, port, ritual)
- **Civic workwear:** knee-length tunic + wrap shorts; braided belts; oiled shoulder capes for squalls. Hats broad but tied; linen veils on pollen days.  
- **Port crews:** quick-drain hems, glove-guards, reed-knees, sling pouches; foremen stripe sleeves.  
- **Choir/temple:** light white/ochre layers; embroidered sun discs; house sashes by Beat.  
- **Marines (escort duty):** shell-lamellar vests, cane bracers, short spears/axes; storm cloaks roll tight.  
_Technical note:_ bast fibers, bamboo weaves, shell-lime wax finishes; indigo/turmeric/mangrove dyes define civic palettes. 

## Faces in the crowd
Compact builds common; sun-dark skin tones; hair tied short against humidity. Port cosmopolitans widen the mix. (See phenotypes guide.)

## Public space & signage
- **Seals & marks:** Oboe disc = civic authority; Beat House glyphs on chapels; Harbor Watch chevrons on towers.  
- **Writing:** blocky temple hands on edicts; neat copperplate in chart schools; printers’ ticket borders on official forms.
- **Tariff stones & premium boards:** chalked daily; rubbed smooth by rain and hands. (Finance context in peak snapshot.) 

## Urban fabric (objects that “read” on camera)
- Storm galleries (arcaded refuges with first-aid and lantern racks).  
- Beacon legs: stacked housings, service ladders, paint bands for range.  
- Slipway quarter: ribbed hulls, reed-keel cradles, sacrificial bow fenders; piles of tinned fittings drying on lines.
- Cistern mouths with brass plates; rain chains; canal scuppers choked with reed fluff when pollen’s up. (Hydrology tie-in.) 

## Motion & logistics (peak pattern)
City galleys and escort cutters nose in/out by bell; barges stack two-deep at grain steps; handcarts bridge the last fifty meters from quay to market. “Watch half-capes” (short, oiled) are visual shorthand for dock authority.

## Festival & calendar moments (Hexennial set)
Hexennial banners in cadence colors; choir tourneys in market squares; Captain-Reps sit high benches at regattas; Beat Six clerks stamp warrants at side tables. (Religion/admin cross-refs.)

## Quick kit lists (useful for scenes)
- **Harbor Watch pair:** whistle, short baton, seal ribbon, lantern, chalk, docket tags.  
- **Compository runner:** slate, twine rolls, proof-leafs, oilcloth satchel.  
- **Marine squad (boarding):** tower shield + spear/axe, sling, lanyarded hanger, rolled cloak; total fight load ~8–10 kg.
