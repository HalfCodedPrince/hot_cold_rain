## Scope & Thesis
The **Northlands** (everything north of the Ord Bay rim and Sar littoral) are three belts:
1) **Kahet Ranges & Stern Littoral** (eastern mountains and the western shore of the Stern Ocean),
2) **Central Uplands** (headwaters feeding the Hundred Crowns rivers),
3) **Western Peninsula & outer archipelagos**.

From c.0–1100 they sit outside imperial administration; 1100–1400 they become **markets-of-convenience** for fish, furs, bast, iron, and later **cartelized ports**. Faith runs **totemic/ancestor** at home, **Rhythm-minimum** in markets. By 1400 AO the lanes touch them seasonally, not yet as provinces.

## Regions at a glance

### A) Kahet Ranges & Stern Littoral
- **Terrain & climate:** steep rain-shadowed spurs, knife valleys; cold current along the **Stern** shore; fog banks; rocky inlets.
- **People:** “Kahet-tribes”—clan terraces in the interior, **shore crews** on the cold coast.
- **Economy:** smoked fish, dried kelp/weed, **sailback oil** (if pods range this far), hardwoods, slate, iron bloomlets from bog-ore; river pearls upriver.
- **Faith & rite:** **Stone-Current / Old Word** in terraces; **Sky-Knife** totems on the shore (bone flutes, trance hunts). Rhythm observed **minimally** at market posts.
- **Ports (seasonal):** rock-notch havens; small palisade marts that “wake” two festivals a year when convoys run.

### B) Central Uplands (river sources to Hundred Crowns)
- **Terrain:** high saddles, peat and heather, sources of the great south-running rivers; winter freezes.
- **People:** hill confederacies → **petty kingdoms** clustered at river heads; feud/feast cycle.
- **Economy:** hides, horn, **furs**, honey and wax, small iron from bloom forges, resin and mast for shipyards; pack trains south in the dry.
- **Faith:** **River-Mother** streams (matrilineal water courts) overlaid with **Splendid Word** proverbs for treaties; Rhythm used to date fairs.

### C) Western Peninsula & Outer Archipelagos
- **Terrain:** low mangrove chokes and swamp forest fingers; exposed spits to the Stern; rich lagoons.
- **People:** “Storm-Brother” totems; trousers (to scandalize southerners), loud drums.
- **Economy:** fish, eels, salt, bast, resin, **wharf timber**; later (13th–14th c.) **Knees** and richer **Hundred Crowns** towns plant **charter colonies** along the outer rim.
- **Faith:** market-blended—**Crum-ward assemblies** meet Rhythm calendars; local storm rites remain.

## Long view (0–1400 AO)

### c.0–400 AO — Quiet edges
- Terrace cults and totems; barter with rare south caravans; occasional temple missions fail in the cold/fog.

### 400–850 — First river fairs
- Southward polities adopt **monsoon calendars**; uplands answer with two headwater fairs; oaths sworn on **oath-stones**; Rhythm treated as a **southern clock**, not a creed.

### 850–1100 — Frontier braid
- Bloomery iron, hides, wax feed south; in return: salt, bronze tools, occasional scribes. Benches post **safe-conduct leaves** but exert no rule.

### 1100–1200 — Beacons failing, pirates rising
- The Broken Lantern onset barely reaches this far; **inshore raiding** increases on the west; uplands fortify fords; fairs shift weeks to avoid pirate seasons.

### 1200–1290 — Mangrove Garrot
- **Knees** & **Hundred Crowns** begin outer-rim colonies; Kahet shore crews trial **escort service** for hire; uplands sell charcoal and bast to convoy outposts.
- **Ord-Kahet** is seeded late in the arc: an **Ord-style charter port** north of the Kahet range (nucleus of **Too-Kahet**).

### 1290–1400 — Knotted Lanterns
- **Knees** late accession to the Principality; colonization westward; **Morum/Vitrana** factors appear at seasonal marts.
- **Kahet leader** bought off (head-silver); successor accepts a **Dona marriage** and the **Ord-Kahet** charter (c.1306–1308).
- **Petty kingdoms** at central river sources stabilize around ritual water courts; levy mercenaries south in green-belt failures.
- **Green Years (1389–1397)**: storms wreck weirs; fish runs crash; **Fishery Ban** rotations push crews onto quay work; prices spike inland.

---

## Trade & logistics
- **Exports:** furs, fish/oil, hides, resin, bast, charcoal, bloom iron, slate, timber, pearls (rare).
- **Imports:** salt, metal tools, cloth, pots, spirits, beads, later **paper leaves** and assay services.
- **Lanes:** coastal tuck-in following fog and lee; **Access Days** matter only at season ports; inland traffic is **pack and punt**.
- **Law:** southern **Prize Dockets** barely reach; most disputes settled by **oath-pits** or water courts; southern benches accept oath-stones if fairs are on time.

---

## Religion in practice
- **Home:** totems and terraces (ancestor tables, storm knives, river mothers).  
- **Market:** **Rhythm minimum** (calendar, oaths, charity) for access to southern credit/assay.  
- **Knees influence:** step-dances and silences travel west with colonies; welcomed as spectacle, not scripture.  
- **Crum assemblies** along the western marts mock corruption in satyr plays; fines preferred over brands.

---

## Conflict & defense
- **Raiding:** canoe raids in mangrove chokes; hill feuds kept by ritual ceasefires; **mercenary bands** sell seasons south.  
- **Arms:** bows, spears, shields; **handgonnes** appear late (14th c.) in market towns; swivels on charter schooners; armor is leather/wood with iron bits.  
- **Policing:** convoy escorts hired seasonally; oath-stones keep truces; southern **Blue Papers** rarely bite unless a port shelters for real.

## Seeds toward 1800 AO (forward hooks)
> (For the political map you’re drafting; not yet realized by 1400, but visible in outline.)
- **PRK (Kllrians):** terrace elites, later an upland revolution after the Last War.  
- **Ord-Bat / Longara / Vitrana:** old Ord colonies and convoy nodes along the north coast—born in the 13th–14th c. as marts & yards.  
- **Wur-City (old Wurran):** river-head market that becomes a fixed town; still half-ritual, half-ledger by 1400.  
- **Northern Cartels:** string of **loose fishing/fur/oil ports** on the Stern shore; precursor trading houses already swap **winter oil** and **weed ash**.  
- **Karodot:** surviving Widiwidi administration core; its agents buy northern bast and oil as convoy ballast.  
- **Free Cities (Hundred Crowns):** remain fractious but hold **Crum nights**; their brokers finance western marts.  
- **Honor Treaty Port:** a late-century **anchorage pact** between **Knees** and **Free Cities** trialed as a truce for the outer archipelagos.
