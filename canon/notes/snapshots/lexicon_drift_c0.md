# Lexicon Drift c.0 AO → later usage

- **“Sun-House Rite”** (Kllrian; Sar analog **“River & Sun Offices”**) → later **Good Old Rhythm** civic calendar.  
- **“House-Songs” / **“Responses”** → later **choirs** by numbered Beats.  
- **“Harbor Collegium”** (Ord) → later **Council of Captains** habit.  
- **“Pilot-Magistrate”** (port officer) → later **Captain-Representative** template.  
- **“Shell-bond”** (inscribed contracts, some on crab shell) → later **printed notes/forms**.  
- **“Flower-Fall”** (pollen rains) → later popular **“green rain.”**  
- **“Sun-Stone”** (seal tablet kept at shrine) → later **Oboe Seal** under Keeper.  
- **“Measure-Stones”** (wet/dry balances + tariff lists at shrines) → later metrology stones and rate boards.

**Script & tongues:** bark-cloth and coated boards; copperplate is centuries away. Loanwords travel by pilots and marriages, not proclamations.
