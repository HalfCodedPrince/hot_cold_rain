# Empire Snapped (c. 1100 AO)

## Governance
- Procedure holds in minutes, not on quays. Keeper seals are clean; **port courts** pick and choose which writs to honor.  
- Captain-Reps act like local dukes; treaty ports argue “contract, not crown.”

## Finance
- **Bond stair** misses a rung; tranches dumped to private houses.  
- Premiums spike on rumor, not weather; **whistle** leafs appear and vanish.

## Works & Transport
- **Beacon Leg Six** dark three festivals in six; dredge cycles skipped.  
- Slipways stay busy repairing the same hulls; inland depots hoard spare iron.

## Religion & Print
- Beat Six warrants still stamped, but **Censor drift** jitters; proscribed choirs sing two streets over.  
- **Seven-Frame presses** hum in basements—forms, almanacs, and lampoons in the same ink.

## Street feel
- Flood marks reach new nails on doorframes. Rate boards chalked, erased, chalked again.  
- Ferries crowd at dusk; rooftop water tanks hum; storm galleries smell of lamp oil and wet paper.

**Matters next:** ports that can feed themselves become states in all but name.
