# Known World, c. 950 AO

## Ord (north)
- **Ord Bay & Salt River** — imperial capital belt; beacons hum; compositories thick.  
  **Matters later:** cartel scandals (insurance × watches × works).
- **Western Littoral** — half-loyal city belts; reef trade, pilotage; “tribute when convenient.”  
  **Matters later:** quick to defect in shocks.
- **Southern Belts (proto–Hundred Crowns)** — dense micro-states, guild oligarchies, festival pomp.  
  **Matters later:** HRE-like paralysis template.
- **Eastern Peninsula (Koi-Hi / Longara seed)** — metropolis of charts & credit; future republican core.  
  **Matters later:** carries the torch after imperial decline.
- **Kahet & North-Ord uplands** — timber, ore, pass tolls; confederations, not kingdoms.  
  **Matters later:** incubator for steppe-like raiding polities.

## Bright Sea (between Ord & Sar)
- **Kllrian Temple States (north arcs)** — terrace hydrology, calendar-tight rites; diplomatic with Council.  
  **Matters later:** schism vectors when rites liberalize.  
- **Hush Isles (southern arcs)** — Cuzhar ruins; light resettlement under taboo; rich reefs, eerie stone.  
  **Matters later:** colonial rush breaks taboo; mutation folklore strong here.

## Sar (south)
- **Littoral cities** — treaty ports; mixed courts; dye/salt wealth; Seven Fingers compliant after the Shoals.  
  **Matters later:** open door to Splendid Word; soft resistance via contracts.  
- **Inland jungles & reed marshes** — sparse roads; riverine pockets; penal ore camps.  
  **Matters later:** revolt flashpoints; disease corridors.

## Widiwidi (far south-west)
- **Fringe mapped** — monsoon coasts, hardwoods, spices; seasonal huts & mission sheds.  
  **Matters later:** becomes the colonial crucible (indentures, press-gangs, mutation lore).

## Beyond the lanes (unknowns)
- **Far north shelves** — fog stories of black water and crystal birds; no charts.  
- **Deep Sar interior** — myths of land-temples that breathe; few returns.
