# Empire at Its Peak (c. 950 AO)

## Governance
- Elections on the drum; Oar-Bench pageant binds crowds to forms.
- Keeper registry routine; Beat Six warrants required for seizures.
- Council posts Captain-Reps sparingly; prefers treaty ports.

**Matters later:** legitimacy is procedural—if the *procedure* cracks (panic, scandal), trust collapses fast.

## Finance & Trade
- Grain notes stable; port tariffs predictable.
- Convoy premiums posted daily; claims courts quick if logs clean.
- Debt Office funds beacons/dredges; compositories print prospectuses.

**Matters later:** stacked maturities; conflict of interest between insurers, watches, works.

## Transport & Works
- Continuous beacon legs around Ord Bay & major Sar capes.
- Harbor Watches certify hours; fog-bells add redundancy.
- Slipways standardized; shallow-draft inland craft common.

**Matters later:** silt & maintenance debt; a single storm cycle can expose thin margins.

## Religion & Culture
- Rhythm rites coordinate calendars; significant divergence from orthodoxy tolerated at fringes.
- Hexennial Games standardized; choir tournaments prestige events.
- Censor’s Bench narrow but present; warrants filed, not waved.

**Matters later:** soft-censor creep; Beats split over frontier syncretisms.

## Knowledge & Tech
- Copperplate chart schools; tide/almanac tables; resin caulking.
- Literacy “wide but shallow” in ports; skilled in choirs/compositories.
- Temple colleges share faculty with chart schools.

**Matters later:** capture of schools by guilds; falsified soundings scandals.

## Cities (ring-ports)
- Ord City and Tau-Hi hubs; Seven Fingers compliant treaty port.
- Insurance Steps & Compository Rows central to urban life.

**Matters later:** cartels & riots if premiums spike; diegetic pamphlet wars.
