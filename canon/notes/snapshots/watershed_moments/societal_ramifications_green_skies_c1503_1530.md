> **Thesis.** The Green Skies convert pamphlet heat into state reach. Cities survive by **lumping difference into law** (Sanctuary + Mixed Court) while exporting risk to packet lanes and hinterlands. Co-Types become **indispensable labor** and **convenient targets**, often in the same ward and hexad.

## I. Phasing in Society
> **Model.** Two-speed society. Beacon-forest corridor & big ports move first; interior & sect-strong regions lag by a generation. “Normalization” is *local* well before it’s *general*.

**Years 0–5 — Panic, famine, militias.**
- **Food & flight.** Crop failures + green haze closures → grain riots; river roads clog; temple burn orders escalate.
- **Violence against Co-Types.** Drownings, burnings, forced “sluice trials”; sect preachers and street theatres make examples.  
- **Power vacuum.** Guild captains, river gangs, and ward beadles rule by **noticeboard**; Plate prints are erratic or seized.  
- **Adult-switchers appear.** A small, visible minority of adults metamorphose; most hide, are exploited, or are killed.  
- **Ad hoc havens.** A handful of port wards (Free-City style) improvise **safe rooms/clinics** to protect labor they need tonight.

**Years 6–15 — Charter experiments (patchy, coastal-first).**
- **Corridor enclaves.** Along the beacon-forest spine and Lotus coast, **charter wards** pilot sanctuary rules, fines-as-theatre, and minimal kit.  
- **First Mixed Courts** A few cities open **line benches** for assault/tort injury & guardianship; most regions don’t.  
- **Exploitation persists.** Freak shows, “miracle tonics,” press-gang salvage; sanctuaries exist **next to** abuse.  
- **Schools refit** only in pilot wards (glare baffles, dry-grip benches, scent-safe inks); elsewhere, greenborn stay home or vanish.

**Years 16–30 — Patchwork stabilization (first greenborn cohort works).**
- **Workforce enters.** The first greenborn adults fill **night inspection (Bat)**, **flood/salvage (Otter)**, **clerks/runners (Fox)** in cities that chartered early.  
- **Identity Rolls (contested).** Corridor cities tie **line+dialect** to plates; privacy fights rage; hinterlands ignore the rolls.  
- **Insurance learns “green years.”** Convoys price risky legs; **clean-lanes** rebates appear where drills/kit are real.  
- **Sect hardening inland.** Drownings fade in ports, continue in valleys. “Resettlement” becomes the polite word for expulsion.

**Years 31–50 — Consolidation vs countermarch.**
- **Standards spread by trade.** Beacon codes, clinic kit lists, and sanctuary charters **follow freight** into second-tier cities.  
- **Counter-edicts.** Principality Steps and sect councils impose censor benches; Lotus/Free cities answer with fines-as-theatre and sanctuary guarantees.  
- **Normalcy with teeth.** In the corridor: mixed courts routine, kit audited, riots rarer but sharper. In the interior: order alternates with pogrom years.

> **Where we differ by map:**  
> **Fast-track:** Ord→Wur→Vitrana→Haru-ahru→Koi-Hi→Tau-Hi→Morum (+ Tau-Hi→Seven Fingers→Knees→Kroth→Grakk).  
> **Middle:** archipelagos & market-road hubs.  
> **Slow/hostile:** interior uplands, sect-dominated valleys, north-tribes rivers.

## II. Governance & Control
- **Green Edicts as System.** Packet monopolies, censor plates (Beat II **Plate Bench**), **Identity Rolls**, fee-farms for closures, **health inspections** run by Steps with Mixed Court oversight.
- **Free Cities vs Principality.** Free Cities lean into **fines-as-theater**; the Principality leans into **reach** (closures, holds, levy pressure). Both rely on Co-Type labor while disciplining its speech at the same time.
- **Rite & Clock.** **Switch Hours** never appear on state calendars, but inspections, clinics, and festival timings **quietly track them**.

## III. Economy & Work (who gets hired, who gets fined)
- **Ports & Locks.** **Otter** lines dominate floodworks and salvage; **Reedcat** dialects rig print lofts.  
- **Dense Wards.** **Bat** lines own night inspection and sealed-packet lofts (no armor aloft; wingsleeves mandatory).  
- **Road & Court.** **Fox** lines fill factor courts and long-road courier guilds; heat kit (vented crowns, ear-port etiquette) becomes a norm.  
- **Premiums.** Green-year premiums spike on routes flagged in `canon/notes/maps/map_mutation_day.yaml`; sanctuaries with **A/B** drill pass get rebates.

## IV. Law, Family, & Kinship
- **Marriage & Cross-Pairs.** Legal across lines; **Switch counseling** recommended. **Resolve-at-birth** doctrine fixes identity rolls; adult partial changes don’t reopen status.  
- **Guardianship.** **greenborn** burials and **overswitch** care standardized in Sanctuary codes.  
- **Negligence & Harm.** New torts: **membrane pinch** (Bat), **smell-binding** injury (Fox workplaces), **cold-water negligence** (Otter crews).  
- **Exploitation Bans.** Prohibitions on “green tonics,” tissue sale; sanctuary warrants only via **Mixed Court**.

## V. Religion, Rumor, & Public Peace
- **Good Old Rhythm.** Public rites retained; **Deafening → Empty Chair** symbolism; **Fifth Bread** frontages serve as ward safety nets.  
- **Oboe at Sea.** The **Endless Green** yields pilot songs and cult stencils (claws on Access Boards). Cities respond with fines or festivals, never proof.
- **Pamphlet Weather.** Lampoon cycles become **clocks** for unrest; rebuttal slips appear bundled with festival programs.

## VI. Education & Etiquette
- **Schools.** Mixed classes are normal; sensory accommodations are basic civic competence.  
- **Etiquette.** Ear-port & wingsleeve respect is posted like fire rules; yanking a hood/wing seam is a fined offense (satyr fines posted).
- **Public Space.** Beacon legs carry **aux patterns** warning of volant work; shrine rails are **membrane-safe**; bathhouses keep **quiet lanes**.

## VII. The Beacon-Forest Spine (Principality core)
- Corridor: **Ord City → Wur → Vitrana → Haru-ahru → Koi-Hi → Tau-Hi → Morum**; branch **Tau-Hi → Seven Fingers → Knees → Kroth → Grakk**.  
- Lore: shared **aux-beacon codes**, 15–25km intercity spacing (5–10km urban); packet priority lanes; satyr-fines posted at towers in Free Cities.

## VIII. Metrics & Knobs (for editors/DMs)
- **Riot Weather (0–5)** = pamphlet heat + food price + closure days − sanctuary compliance.  
- **Sanctuary Drill (A–D)** = clinic kit completeness, evacuation drills, aux-beacon literacy.  
- **Court Load (cases/hexad)** = Mixed Court throughput (guild disputes + cross-pair filings).  
- **greenborn Rate (‰ births)** = falls with clinics; rural lags.  
- **Premium Ladder (% over base)** = green year + route risk; rebate for “clean lanes” sanctuaries.
