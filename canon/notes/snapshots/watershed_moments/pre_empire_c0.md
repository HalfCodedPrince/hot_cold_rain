# Pre-Empire c.0 AO — Major Players

- **Kllrian Temple-States (REG:KLR-ARC):** terrace hydrology + temple bureaucracy; port causeways; embassies by choir. *Matters later:* calendar authority, credential habits, and terrace engineers that Sar–Ord will copy.

- **South-Ord Riverine League (REG:ORD-SOUTH):** canal-walled cities trading grain, salt, and lime; harbor collegia forming. *Matters later:* collegia become the bones of the Council culture.

- **Sar Littoral City Leagues (REG:SAR-LIT):** dye/salt metropolises; mixed guild/temple courts; stepped shrines; refugee memory from Krum. *Matters later:* treaty-port DNA and mixed-court playbook.

- **Kahet Pass Cantons (REG:KAH-UP):** toll shrines, goat herders, winter roads; hostage-surety is law. *Matters later:* the legal template for later pass compacts.

- **Hush Isles Custodians:** watchmen over Krum ruins; salvage tithes fund shrines. *Matters later:* taboo → colonial rush centuries on.

**Meta:** There is no empire; there are **procedures** and **prestige**. Those win.
