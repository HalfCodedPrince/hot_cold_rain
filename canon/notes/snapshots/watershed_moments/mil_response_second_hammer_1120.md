## Situation
- **Upland confederations** cut timber/ore roads and fairs; convoy inputs thin. Ports keep law **on paper** while feeding local strongmen off-book. 
- Post-1100, procedure **holds in minutes, not on quays**; Captain-Reps act like local dukes; beacons gappy; Seven-Frame presses hum. 

## Order of Battle (paper vs ground)
- **Paper O/B:** two muster columns per pass district; riverine detachment; Watch auxiliaries on quays.  
- **Ground truth:** columns step off **≤60% strength**, reliefs miss beacon windows, Watch units refuse out-of-ward duty without fee. (See muster & marque drift.)  

## Command & Control
- **Council circulars** issue fast (Seven-Frame), but obeyed selectively by port courts; Watch bells outrank convoy horns in crises. 
- **Letters of marque** expanded: privateers double as “escort” inland, creating gray militias with claims on salvage and fines.

## Tactics observed
**What worked**
- **Shelf-hold doctrine:** Pass detachments fortify shelves and **wait for foul-weather egress** instead of chasing.  
- **Guide control:** bounty for **hostage guides** + oaths at temple courts reduced mid-march defections.  
- **River night runs:** low-freeboard barges pushed under overcast; no silhouette against Hex.

**What failed**
- **Timed relief by beacon:** with **Legs** dark or out of cadence, clockwork plans slipped. 
{index=3}  
- **Mixed writs:** Watch writs vs Council dockets → standoffs; two festivals lost at a time on signatures.  
- **Gray fleets ashore:** marque crews demanded prize shares on **land seizures**, clogging claims with the Insurance office.

## Case notes (brief)
- **White-Firs Shelf:** shelf-hold saved a quarter column; rain-slick quicklime broke a night charge.  
- **Salt-Fork Ferries:** twin barges lashed as floating redoubt; convoy signal code repurposed for shore whistles.  
- **Lantern-Cay Burn:** haven taken twice; both times rebuilt in a fortnight under new colors.

## Logistics
- **Ration rails** (grain notes) valid in core wards; worthless two marches out.  
- **Spare iron** hoarded inland since c.1100; slipways repair the same hulls repeatedly. 

## Assessment
- The center can **print** a war faster than it can **fight** one; obedience has become **interpretation**.  
- Sustainable posture = **local shelves + hired screens + night river**; anything larger requires beacon reliability we no longer have.

**Matters later:** treaty ports formalize **Contract Port** jurisprudence; Watch houses remain **de facto militias**; pamphlet wars sharpen from finance to doctrine.
