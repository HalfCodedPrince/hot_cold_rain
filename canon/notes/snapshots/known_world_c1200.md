## Ord (north)
- **Ord Bay & Salt River** — procedure intact; authority thin. Captain-Reps are patrimonial; **Steps** post premiums by rumor as often as weather.
- **Western Littoral** — city belts hedge: treaty forms in daylight, private war at night; “contract road” toll leagues. 
- **Kaheet / uplands** — pass confeds tax timber and ore; port writs honored only with gifts.

## Bright Sea
- **Kllrian Temple States** — conservative revival: terrace guards, harbor tithe courts; diplomacy over deployment.  
- **Hush Isles** — taboo fraying: pop-up markets tied to gray fleets; mutation folklore thick.

## Sar (south)
- **Contract Ports** — treaty models narrowed into city charters; mixed courts dominant; escorts hired by subscription.  
- **Interior** — reed-marsh corridors governed by compact; temple clinics ride with convoy missions.

## Widiwidi
- Seasonal colony attempts; mission sheds double as exchange posts; storms erase two for every one that sticks.

## Unknowns
- **Far north shelves** — chart gaps widen; pilots trade **errata leafs** with folklore addenda.
