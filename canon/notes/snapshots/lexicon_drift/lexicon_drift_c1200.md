> **Scope.** How the koiné thins and street speech hardens as ports go practical. Use this to flavor dialogue and signage after c.1150.

## Offices & institutions (koiné → common speech)
| Concept (gloss) | c.950 koiné | **c.1200 common** | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Council of Captains | Council (of Captains) | **Captains’ Council**, **Sea Council** | Narrowed to maritime scope locally. 
| Captain-Representative | Captain-Representative | **Port-Rep**, **Captain-Post** | “Rep” as office property (sale/pledge). |
| Harbor Watches | Harbor Watches | **Coast Wards**, **Bell-men** | Ward militias in fact; “Wards” on chalkboards. 
| Censor’s Bench | Censor’s Bench | **Censorate** | Warrant drift → bureaucratic noun. |
| Treaty Port | Treaty Port | **Contract Port** | Charters & mixed courts as first language. |
| Insurance Steps | Insurance Steps | **Steps**, **Claim-stairs** | “Blue papers” = emergency premium notices. |

## Sea & convoy
- **Broken Chain** (dark beacon run) replaces neutral “Leg outage.”  
- **Ticket-men** (licensed privateers) vs **cloak-men** (unlicensed) in Sar.  
- **Errata leaf** becomes **pilot’s mercy** in jokes (Relief by leaflet, not by ship).

## Law & money
- **War docket** keeps name; **bench-docket** appears for ward levies.  
- **Grain note** → **meal-ticket** in poorer wards; **bond stair** survives but as **ladder** in street speech.

## Place & people
- **Kahet** yields **the Passes** (metonym for confed lands).

## Recording drift (pattern)
