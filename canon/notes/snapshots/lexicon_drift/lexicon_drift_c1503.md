> **Scope.** Street-and-office vocabulary in the **weeks to morning-of** the Day of Green Skies. Use to tune dialogue, signage, fines, rites, and convoy paperwork. See c.1200 for earlier drifts and baselines.

## Offices & Institutions (koiné → **c.1503 street**)
| Concept (gloss) | c.1400–koiné | **c.1503 street/common** | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access Days Board (convoy calendar) | Access Days Board | **Access Board**, **Ratings Board** | “Ratings” evokes **Cleanliness Tables** posted by Steps. |
| Censorate / Text Office | Censorate | **Plate Office**, **Plate Bench** | Titles include **Plate Registrar** (Beat II). |
| Harbor Watches (port militia) | Harbor Watches | **Coast Wards**, **watch beadles** | Chalk slates & fines foregrounded over brands. |
| Postal/Packet Office | Post & Packets | **Packet Room**, **Oboe-Packet** (edicts) | Oboe-Packet is the monopoly nickname expected under emergency edicts. |
| Charity & Public Health (Beat V) | Infirmaries & soup | **Fifth bread**, **soup yard** | Beat Five’s visible face in wards. |
| Discipline & Courts (Beat VI) | Discipline House | **Sixth whips**, **bench police** | Joint benches–Steps reach anticipated in edict talk. |
| Free City punishments | Branding | **satyr fines** | Fines replace brands; posted like playbills. |

## Street Signals & Policing
- **short–short–long** → lane-clear whistle/hand-sign code; taught to children as a game and respected when beadles appear.  
- **Broken Chain** → beacon run with two legs dark/one canted; shorthand for “watch your papers.”  
- **aux leg** / **aux beacons** → rooftop cans painted moss-dark; neighborhood workarounds when main legs fail.

## Print, Stage & Dissent (pamphlet weather)
- **lampoon cycles** → popular label for rebuttal chains; pressrooms “run hot.”  
- **printer raids** → plate seizures by watch + Steps; fines often posted in chalk.  
- **samizdat routes** → fog-gate marts and stern ports that quietly pass bundles and close the gate when heat rises.  
- **Access leverage** → boycotts and festival-calendar pressure by wards and guilds; “no Access, no custom.”

## Religion, Rites & Law (Good Old Rhythm, visibly)
- **Deafening** (old terror) → **Empty Chair** (symbol only), a portico prop to remind rather than use.  
- **Sea-Lotus** (humanist current) → **Lotus rooms**, **Lotus baths** as placenames in Sar-littoral wards.  
- **Splendid Word** (syncretists) → **Word corners** (hymn-card stalls, mixed hands).

## Ports, Convoys & Paper
- **blue papers** → emergency premiums/closures on Steps doors; “blue” generalizes to **blue notice**.  
- **Prize docket** → routine end to convoy skirmishes; paperwork beats sackings.  
- **Rate-Hold Books** → pilotry/lee rules and convoy discipline copied into ledgers.  
- **Mangrove Ordinance** live terms: **cleanse marks**, **crab death**, **Factors’ Row**, **Mangrove Garden** (licensed fence).

## Refugees, Enclaves & Charters
- **Stone Rooms** → quiet Kllrian study-houses in uplands/Ord-Kahet; Old Word kept.  
- **Co-Type** / **Charter Enclave** → company-type mixed-court neighborhoods near southern depots.  
- **Lotus-Word wards** → Free-Cities quays where **Lotus** and **Word** stalls mix fonts and hymn-cards.

## Weather & Daily Management (Green Rain drift)
- **green day** → nuisance tint + pollen; temple **rinse-time** placards posted; **roof-walk cautions** become common phrasing.  
- Household kit lexemes: **pollen traps**, **veil combs**, **oilcloth chest-wraps**.

## Calendar & Measure (everyday speak)
- **hexad** → six-day week; “see you next hexad” normal in ports.  
- **Songs** (months) and **festival floats** → ordinary scheduling talk.

## Theater & Penalties
- **satyr fines** → posted in lieu of brands; boards read like playbills in Free Cities.  
- **sackings** → playhouse destruction in hot wards; becomes a verb (“they sacked the Satyr”).

## Drift Patterns (append to base aliases)
Add new era-aliases to base lexicon entries as they harden:
