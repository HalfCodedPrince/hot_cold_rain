> This addendum amends the base c.1200 snapshot with developments that define 1200–1215 and set up the Mangrove Garrot era.

## Signals & Rates
- Intermittent **beacon outages** across three rows; **Blue Papers** posted by Insurers; independents hug the coast.
- **Bench-dockets** proliferate; convoy **tickets** become transferable scripts at core wards only.

## Ord & Bay
- **Ord**: Works lists skew to oil/rope; Debt Office rolls dredge/beacon stair; escorts paid by subscription.
- **Ord Bay (east)**: first **Ord-affiliated colonies** emerging on marshy peninsulas; scrip acceptance limited.

## Sar Littoral
- **Tau-Hi**: delta city expands bonded granaries; agents scout eastern Sar (temperate rainforest cutting + mushroom cultivation + wetlands).
- **Knees vs Seven Fingers**: low-grade **Charter War** over reef-cut gate fees; convoys pick sides.

## Killian Archipelagos
- **Northern Cities**: assay stall licensed; Steps permitted to post; convoys frequent.
- **Southern Cities**: flirt with raider sanctuary; tithes in kind; grain shortages in failure years.

## Hundred Crowns & Hinterland
- **Hundred Crowns**: ritualized town fights continue; mercenary-trader bands circulate; river towns push higher on western Ord tributaries.

## Lane Rumors (setups)
- “Plume line” stories from far east (volcanic caps over the horizon) circulate among pilots.
- Steps trial **Rate-Holds** on smaller in-sea lanes; paperwork is ready before the Widiwidi window is truly known.

## What To Watch (pointers into the era file)
- 1205–1215: seasonal pirate republic in mangroves; republic attempts fail for lack of grain/assay.
- Procurement shifts: escorts treated as Works items; insurers coordinate premiums with tender calendars.
