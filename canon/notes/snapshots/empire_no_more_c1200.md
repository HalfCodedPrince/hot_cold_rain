## Governance
- **Form without force:** Keeper seals clean; **port courts** pick and choose writs; Captain-Reps treat postings as property. 
- **Charter cascade:** treaty models â†’ **Contract Port** charters; hinterlands acknowledge **whoever arrives** with food and bells. 

## Finance
- **Bond stairs** re-cut locally; Debt Office paper trades at discounts; private houses set real rates. 
- Insurance premia float with rumor; whistle leafs surface then vanish. 

## Transport & Works
- Beacon **legs gappy**; dredge cycles skipped; pilots navigate on errata and habit. Slipways repair **the same hulls** in loops. 

## Religion & Print
- Beat Six warrants still stamped, but **censor drift** blurs scope; **Seven-Frame presses** hum in cellars (forms, almanacs, lampoons). 

## Street feel
- Flood marks fresh; Steps chalked/erased; roof tanks hum; storm galleries smell of lamp oil and wet paper. 

**Matters next:** ports that feed themselves are states in all but name; Blindness spreads inland by ledger first, then by road.
