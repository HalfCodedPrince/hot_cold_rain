> **Scope & stance.** A conservative collegium brief (annotated for Steps/Plate) covering what’s actionable: taxon, development, fertility/cross rules, clinic practice, clothing/kit standards by line, and the legal frame that keeps cities functioning.

## 1) Taxon & Morph Program (what they are)
- **Taxon.** Co-Types are **Homo sapiens** expressing **canalized morph packages** (stable sets), not chimeras.  
- **Systems touched.** **Neural-crest derivatives** (face/ear cartilage/skin glands), **limb proportions**, sensory emphasis. **Pelvis, spine, brain plan, larynx** remain human-envelope; speech and executive cognition intact.  
- **Adult changes.** Rare and partial (dermis/cartilage). Full skeletal re-patterning is overwhelmingly prenatal.

### Major lines (administrative “lumps”, street treats them as distinct)
| Line | Salient morphology | Sensory/physio color | Common guild niches |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bat** | Elongate forearm/digits II–V; flank–hip membrane; scapular/pectoral remodel; retaining manipulating thumbs | Night-tilted circadian; strong scotopic vision; 3D spatial working memory; vestibular finesse | night inspection, signal runners, bell-tower/beacon access, packet lofts |
| **Otter** | Partial webbing; dense coat; dive reflex & thorax compliance; ear baffles common | Parasympathetic “drop” near water; cold/wet tolerance; tool fidgeting | flood crews, salvage, locks, riverine pilots |
| **Fox** | Craniofacial length; mobile pinnae; fine pelage; tendon elasticity | Olfactory-heavy memory; heat/airflow “loud”; quick attentional shifts | factor courts, messengers, Steps clerks, copyists |

> **Dialects.** Cold-adapted otter and distance-gait fox are **registered as dialects** of their parent line administratively; wards often treat them as their “own kind” anyway.

## 2) Development & “Switch Hours”
- **Switch Hours.** A handful of **gestational windows** where exposure differences (esp. green-year conditions) correlate with morph outcome.  
- **Practice.** Midwives maintain **Switch Ledgers** (sealed), rinse cards, roof-walk cautions; clinics time appointments accordingly.  
- **Street life.** “Switch almanacs” bloom beside Access Boards. Blame and superstition follow the numbers.  
- **Nomenclature.** **greenborn** (euphemism for early nonviables); **overswitch** (developmental cancers; coded in ledgers).

## 3) Fertility, Cross-Pair Rules & Obstetrics (clinical, brief)
- **Compatibility.** Anatomically compatible across Co-Types and baseline humans.  
- **Fertility.** **Reduced but real** (≈10–25% below baseline, pairing-dependent). Obstetric risk is the key constraint (size mismatch, pelvis, fetal head length).  
- **Cross outcomes.** Fetus **resolves** to **baseline** or one **stable package**; **maternal morph bias** common; paternal genotype nudges odds.  
- **Adult mixed lines.** No “blend” phenotypes; canalization precludes mash-ups.  
- **Care.** Switch counseling, green-year advisories, assisted reproduction for anxious pairings; sanctuary clinics publish **quiet manuals** (Plate-cleared).

### Midwife card (pocket version)
- Confirm **Switch window**; schedule rinse/rest; avoid roof-walks on **green days**.  
- Watch **pelvic–fetal proportion**; refer early for long-snout/long-arm expectations.  
- Code adverse outcomes as **greenborn**; escalate **overswitch** signs.

## 4) Clinics & Study (how much medicine they get)
- **0–3 AO-years post-event:** ad hoc green clinics, descriptive practice; high **greenborn** share.  
- **3–10:** **Sanctuary Clinics** formalize; Switch counseling standard; Steps run morbidity registers. Manuals circulate; theory throttled.  
- **10–30:** endowed physiology chairs in 2–3 collegia; better obstetrics drops **greenborn** and overswitch rates sharply in ports; hinterlands lag.

**Standard sanctuary kit:** veil combs; rinse-time cards; oiled felt; ear baffles (otter, bat); membrane guards (bat); anti-slip varnish; salt lozenges; cooling pads; scent-neutral soaps/inks; discreet harness fittings.

## 5) Clothing & Equipment Standards (by line)
Design goals: **don’t fight the morphology**, **vent heat**, **protect working tissues**, **leave hands free**.

### Bat (volant work)
- **Wingsleeves** (soft cuffs that gather membrane safely); **shoulder cradles** to offload pectoral strain; **no armor aloft**.  
- **Launch aids:** ledge straps, mast pegs; **tool harness** centered of mass, low swing.  
- **Weather kit:** membrane oil, spare patch tabs; ear wind-hoods.  
- **Formal wear:** open-back half-capes; ribbon routes that avoid membrane pinch.

### Otter (semi-aquatic)
- **Hydro weave** (oiled felt/linen blend) that sheds water without smell-binding; **quick-drain hems**; wrist **dry cords**.  
- **Ear baffles** and canal stoppers for cold dives; **anti-slip soles** for wet stone.  
- **Work aprons** that fold up as drag-guards; rust-gentle tool wraps.  
- **Formal wear:** dark, matte finishes; **reed-edge trims** that dry fast.

### Fox (heat-wise city life)
- **Vented crowns** (mesh caps) with **evaporative pads** over pinna roots; **ear-friendly hoods** (no pinch).  
- **Open-weave half-capes** with shoulder vents; **sweat-channel seams**; light dyes that don’t trap heat or smell.  
- **Footing:** quiet soles; ankle wraps for distance gaits.  
- **Formal wear:** structured collars that clear ear sweep; scent-safe inks and papers.

> **Shared norms:** dye/ink selection to avoid **smell binding**; ribbon paths that respect ears/wings; quick-release clasps on work harnesses; **no fine dust** in membrane fabrics.

## 6) Law & Status (keeping cities running)
- **Sanctuary Ward** (charter). Defines protected residence, clinic access, levy rates, and riot thresholds; permits ward-level closures (“blue notice”).  
- **Mixed Court** (jurisdiction). Tries Co-Type–specific injury, guild disputes, marriage/guardianship, and **Switch negligence** cases; keeps sealed ledgers.  
- **Identity Rolls** (Green Edicts). Registers line & dialect; ties to convoy/passport plates; privacy limits defined by Plate.  
- **Guild law.** Recognizes line-specific safety kit as **mandatory workplace standard** (failure → fine & closure).  
- **Marriage & Kinship.** Cross-pairing legal; **Switch counseling recommended**, not compelled. Guardianship extends to **greenborn** burials and overswitch care.  
- **Inheritance.** “Resolve-at-birth” doctrine prevents mid-life disputes (adult partial changes don’t alter settled status).  
- **Anti-exploitation.** Bans on “green tonics,” tissue trade; sanctuary search/seizure only via **Mixed Court** warrant.

## 7) Education & Public House
- **Schooling.** Sensory accommodations: glare management (bat), dry grip tables (otter), scent-neutral classrooms (fox).  
- **Public spaces.** **Beacon codes** include aux-leg patterns for volant warnings; shrine steps add **membrane-safe rails**; bathhouses run **quiet lanes** for otter lines.

## 8) Lexicon & Etiquette (to keep usage steady)
- **Use:** Co-Type, line (Bat/Otter/Fox), dialect (cold-otter, distance-fox).  
- **Clinic codes:** **greenborn**, **overswitch**, **Switch Hours**.  
- **Law:** Sanctuary Ward, Mixed Court, Identity Rolls, packet hold, **Sixth Whips** (discipline), **Fifth Bread** (charity frontage).  
- **Avoid:** street slurs in narration; keep them to quoted speech when necessary for tone.

## 9) Writer knobs (safe dials)
- Raise/Lower early tragedy by moving **greenborn**/overswitch rates; never require it in later years.  
- Emphasize/Downplay **Switch superstition** without touching clinic practice.  
- Tighten/loosen **Plate secrecy** on theory without altering clinic manuals.
