The World themes:
Melancholy, malaise and mutability. 

The hot, always fickle tropical jungles, and the Bitch-queen of the seas color the rains green under the bright lantern of a jade-hue moon. Things fall apart, grow again from nothing in the morning - only to rot under the incessant heatwave, as a gutted fish on an old market stall.

Just a century ago, the world was a cruel, unfair, but ordered place, covered by the blanket of the countless garish heraldries of the Greater Principality. A country, a state, a bureaucratic nightmare of semi-independent lands with its diet bursting with fat, and its Emperor an inbreed imbecile, the Principality was a mad and blind mistress. It is long gone now, after tearing itself and all the world apart in a war that lasted half a century. 

The year is 1803 A.O, 52 years since the end of the Last War. The wounds to the world still fester under the skin of normalcy, and the earth remains puckered with the smallpox of undetonated artillery shells. The seasons change, rapid and harsh. The life crawls on; people go about their little triumphs and tragedies as best they can, and every sunrise is still met by the votive songs of the Good Old Rhythm. 

And underneath the buds of progress and hope, there’s an underlying malaise, a patchwork of directionless rage and listlessness. The cities are full of old orphans, older soldiers, and mangroves of refugees, each an echo of a dying empire’s rapid crescendo. The destitute, the angry and the young are sinking their teeth into life, clinging to it with frenzied abandon; the old, the rich and the powerful are losing their sanity to the fitful slumber of excess. 

This is Shana Mutatorem, the age of change, pain and mutation, set amid the decaying ruins of what once was. And may the Oboe spare your sight, seafarer.
