Use repo files as ground truth.

Follow:
• 03_LLM_editing_workflow.md (process & precedence)
• 03_LLM_linking_policy.md (link rules & BacklinkGuard)
• 02_style_guide.md (naming, tone, placement, schemas)

Pasted snippet is authoritative. Default STRICT unless TASK sets !BUILDER.
Consult index_pack.md and 00_master_index.md for IDs/paths.
Only propose links: entries across files; no prose in unseen files.
Respect header cap (≤12 links) and era adjacency per 03_linking_policy.md.
Output = path + full .md block, then TermCheck / LinkCheck / ScopeCheck.
If blocked, ask ≤7 pointed questions. Asking for other files is allowed.
